          1. About IOP
        </HelpHeading>
        <HelpBody>
        IOP is an interactive web-based API that is designed to provide historical statistical information about diseases in each country including COVID-19, as well as providing insight into the possibility of potential future outbreaks. The API also provides information about past and predicted future data on stocks, petrol prices, jobs market and much more to be added later.
        </HelpBody>
        <HelpBody>
        The API is a team project developed in 2022 by 5 students from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Sydney Australia. As it is still a work in progress, many features have not yet been implemented and more UI improvements are expected to take place over time. On that note, if the user suspects there is an error or bug in the application, or would like to make any suggestions for improvements or submit a general inquiry,
        please see the <Link to = '#3' style = {{color: "#888"}} smooth>Contact the developers</Link> section.

        2.1.1. The slider lets you change the time of the disease heat map in monthly increments starting from December 2019.
        As you slide through the timeline, it will give an overview of the relative number of cases in each country for that month/year.
        The countries will be colour-coded to show the amount of new cases per country.
        Countries with fewer cases will be lighter in colour, whereas countries with more cases will be darker.
