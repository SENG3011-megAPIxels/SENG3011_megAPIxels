The group emphasized that BA.2 should continue to be monitored as a distinct sublineage of omicron by public health authorities.\r\n\r\nThe omicron variant of concern is currently the dominant variant circulating globally, accounting for nearly all sequences reported to GISAID. Omicron is made up of several sublineages, each of them being monitored by WHO and partners. Of them, the most common ones are BA.1, BA.1.1 (or Nextstrain clade 21K) and BA.2 (or Nextstrain clade 21L). At a global level, the proportion of reported sequences designated BA.2 has been increasing relative to BA.1 in recent weeks; however, the global circulation of all variants is reportedly declining.\r\n\r\nBA.2 differs from BA.1 in its genetic sequence, including some amino acid differences in the spike protein and other proteins. Studies have shown that BA.2 has a growth advantage over BA.1. Studies are ongoing to understand the reasons for this growth advantage, but initial data suggest that BA.2 appears inherently more transmissible than BA.1, which currently remains the most common omicron sublineage reported. This difference in transmissibility appears to be much smaller than, for example, the difference between BA.1 and delta. Further, although BA.2 sequences are increasing in proportion relative to other omicron sublineages (BA.1 and BA.1.1), there is still a reported decline in overall cases globally.\r\n\r\nStudies are evaluating the risk of reinfection with BA.2 compared to BA.1. Reinfection with BA.2 following infection with BA.1 has been documented; however, initial data from population-level reinfection studies suggest that infection with BA.1 provides strong protection against reinfection with BA.2, at least for the limited period for which data are available.\r\n\r\nWhile reaching the above determination, the TAG-VE also looked at preliminary laboratory data from Japan generated using animal models without any immunity to SARS-CoV-2 which highlighted that BA.2 may cause more severe disease in hamsters compared to BA.1. They also considered real-world data on clinical severity from South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Denmark, where immunity from vaccination or natural infection is high: in these data, there was no reported difference in severity between BA.2 and BA.1.\r\n\r\nWHO will continue to closely monitor the BA.2 lineage as part of omicron and requests countries to continue to be vigilant, to monitor and report sequences, as well as to conduct independent and comparative analyses of the different omicron sublineages.\r\n\r\nThe TAG-VE meets regularly and continues to discuss available data on transmissibility and severity of variants, and their impact on diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n******\r\n[B] South Korea: training to make vaccines\r\nDate: Wed 23 Feb 2022 10:32 EST\r\nSource: Reuters [edited]\r\n<https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-plans-second-hub-training-countries-make-covid-vaccines-2022-02-23/>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday [23 Feb 2022] it has set up a hub in South Korea to train low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines and therapies, and is expanding its COVID-19 vaccine project to a further 5 nations. The new training hub comes after the UN agency set up a technology transfer hub in Cape Town, South Africa, last year [2021] to give companies from poor and middle-income countries the know-how to produce COVID-19 vaccines based on mRNA technology.\r\n\r\nThe new hub outside Seoul will provide workforce training to all countries wishing to produce products such as vaccines, insulin, monoclonal antibodies, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press briefing. \"Currently, bio-manufacturing training facilities are located mainly in high income countries..., putting them out of reach for many lower income countries,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe facility in South Korea is already carrying out training for companies based in the country and will now accommodate trainees from other countries, the WHO said. The WHO also said 5 more countries -- Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Serbia and Viet Nam -- will receive support from its mRNA technology transfer hub in South Africa. The countries have been vetted by a group of experts and proved to have the capacity to move to production stage relatively quickly, the WHO said.\r\n\r\nLast week, 6 African countries -- Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia -- signed up as the 1st on the continent to receive the technology to manufacture mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday [23 Feb 2022], Tedros said that so far 20 countries had expressed interest in getting training on developing an mRNA vaccine by the South African hub. The WHO said it is currently prioritising countries that do not have mRNA technology but already have some manufacturing infrastructure and capacity.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Manojna Maddipatla]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] MIS-C: rare in vaccinated teens\r\nDate: Wed 23 Feb 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/02/mis-c-rare-covid-vaccinated-teens-study-finds>\r\n\r\n\r\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is rare among 12- to 20-year-olds who have received COVID-19 vaccination, a study yesterday [22 Feb 2022] in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health suggests (<https://bit.ly/3phMOsQ>).\r\n\r\nThe study was based on 9 months of follow-up data on US children and young adults ages 12-20 who had received at least one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine from 14 Dec 2020 to 31 Aug 2021. Only 21 cases out of more than 21 million vaccinated adolescents developed the rare disorder, which mimics Kawasaki's, during the follow-up period. Fifteen of the 21 were diagnosed as having COVID-19 despite vaccination, while 6 developed MIS-C for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n\"Our results suggest that MIS-C cases following COVID-19 vaccination are rare and that the likelihood of developing MIS-C is much greater in children who are unvaccinated and get COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone aged 5 years and older in the United States for the prevention of COVID-19,\" said Anna R. Yousaf, MD, the lead author and a researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in a Lancet press release (<https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/943996>).\r\n\r\nOf the 21 patients, all were admitted to the hospital, with 12 requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). None died, and the median hospital stay was 7 days.\r\n\r\nOf those who developed MIS-C, 11 received one dose and 10 received 2 doses of the vaccine before MIS-C onset. Median time from dose to hospitalization was 8 days for those who had received one vaccine dose and 5 days for those who had received 2.\r\n\r\nThe rate of one case per one million vaccinated adolescents is significantly lower than the rate of 200 MIS-C cases per million in unvaccinated children infected with SARS-CoV-2, the authors said.\r\n\r\nIn the 6 cases of MIS-C in the study that occurred in children who had gotten the vaccine but had no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the authors said they were unable to determine if the vaccine contributed to the development of MIS-C, or if there were other reasons for the illness, such as other unrecognized conditions.\r\n\r\nAccording to the CDC, there have been 59 deaths from MIS-C linked to COVID-19 infections, and 6851 cases since surveillance began in May 2020. The average age of an MIS-C patient in the United States is 9 years, 60% of patients are male, and 59% of cases have occurred in children who are Latino or Black (<https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#mis-national-surveillance>).\r\n\r\nThough most pediatric COVID-19 infections are mild and self-limiting, MIS-C has confounded clinicians since the beginning of the pandemic. MIS-C usually appears 2 to 6 weeks after COVID-19 infection, and it can cause major organ failure. Initial symptoms often include fever, rash, eye redness, and gastrointestinal complications.\r\n\r\nIn a commentary on the study, Joyce Chang, MD, MSCE, and Mary Beth Son, MD, both of Boston Children's Hospital, write that the study is reassuring (<https://bit.ly/3ImAb7t>). \"As COVID-19 vaccines were being introduced to the paediatric population, there were fears that vaccination could induce a hyperinflammatory response akin to MIS-C,\" they said. \"Concerns about post-vaccination MIS-C stemmed from uncertainties surrounding MIS-C's immunopathogenesis.\"\r\n\r\nInstead, Chang and Son say the study results offer assurance that the vaccines do not trigger MIS-C in children. More work will be needed to track MIS-C in children age 5-11 years who were approved to get vaccinated just as this study came to an end.\r\n\r\n\"In evaluating individuals with a MIS-C clinical presentation after COVID-19 vaccination,\" the study authors concluded, \"it is important to consider alternative diagnoses, and anti-nucleocapsid antibody testing might be helpful.... Our findings suggest that MIS-C without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is rare after COVID-19 vaccination.\"\r\n\r\n[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] News scan for 23 Feb 2022\r\n[A] COVID vaccines and blood clots\r\nDate: Wed 23 Feb 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/02/news-scan-feb-23-2022>\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo independent UK studies published yesterday [22 Feb 2022] in PLOS Medicine find only a very slight risk of blood clots in the brain after receipt of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine and none after the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Both studies were led by University of Edinburgh researchers.\r\n\r\nThe 1st study involved analysis of the electronic health records of 46 million adults in England, 21 million of whom were vaccinated during the study period of December 2020 to March 2021 (<https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003926>). After adjusting for demographic characteristics and underlying illnesses, the risk of blood clots blocking an artery or vein was slightly lower in the 28 days after vaccination with either the AstraZeneca or AstraZeneca vaccine in people 70 years and older. In people younger than 70, the risk was similar in the 28 days but rose slightly for venous blood clots in the brain after AstraZeneca.\r\n\r\nThis finding corresponded to an estimated excess risk of 0.9-3 per million, depending on age and sex, about twice that of unvaccinated people. The authors, however, said the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination likely exceed the risk.\r\n\r\n\"We were able to show that these risks occur only in people under 70 years old with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and that the increase in risk is extremely small -- no more than a few people per million vaccinated,\" lead author William Whiteley, BM BCh, PhD, said in a PLOS news release (<https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/943615>).\r\n\r\nThe 2nd study involved a dataset of 11.6 million adults in England, Scotland, and Wales from December 2020 through June 2021 (<https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003927>). The researchers compared rates of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), a rare kind of blood clot in the brain, in the 90 days before vaccination with Pfizer or AstraZeneca with the rate in the 4 weeks after vaccination.\r\n\r\nThere was a small elevated risk of CVST after AstraZeneca vaccination, equivalent to one additional event per 4 million people vaccinated, or about twice as high as before vaccination. \"This evidence may be useful in risk-benefit analyses of vaccine policies and in providing quantification of risks associated with vaccination to the general public,\" the researchers concluded.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n\r\n---\r\n[B] Digital health guidance for pandemics\r\nDate: Wed 23 Feb 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/02/news-scan-feb-23-2022>\r\n\r\n\r\nA consensus statement by 13 international leaders in public health, digital health, and healthcare today [23 Feb 2022] in JAMA Network Open provides a roadmap for the implementation of digital health policy for healthcare and local, national, and international governments to address the COVID-19 pandemic and future crises (<https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789277>).\r\n\r\nDigital health refers to the use of computing platforms, networks, software, and sensors to improve the ability to diagnose and treat diseases. The group created the Riyadh Declaration on Digital Health using the proceedings of the Riyadh Global Digital Health Summit in August 2020. Stakeholders identified high-priority issues within the themes of team, transparency and trust, technology, \"techquity\" (addressing health disparities), and transformation.\r\n\r\nTheir 9 recommendations are to:\r\n- Implement evidence-based protocols for effective communication to the public\r\n- Work globally to address misinformation on social and mass media\r\n- Develop a standard global dataset for public health reporting\r\n- Ensure prioritization of digital health\r\n- Provide technology to collect and share data quickly\r\n- Develop a healthcare workforce able to address current and future public health crises\r\n- Ensure that surveillance systems enable a public health response while respecting privacy\r\n- Create digital personal tools and services to support disease prevention, testing, management, and vaccination\r\n- Fund and create innovative surveillance systems for rapid preparedness and optimal global response\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 revealed weaknesses in global healthcare systems and public health responses, including the lack of long-term investment in digitization health information, collaboration, interoperability, and integrity, the authors said.\r\n\r\n\"The collection of data for public health surveillance was irregular...and few countries or communities had pandemic preparedness plans that enabled them to rapidly expand their data capture abilities to accurately monitor and track key outbreak information,\" they wrote. \"Contact tracing had previously relied heavily on analog systems and could not be scaled up rapidly.\" Implementation of the recommendations could ultimately lower fatalities and unite countries in confronting current and future pandemics, the authors said.\r\n\r\nIn a related commentary, Lennart Reifels, PhD, of the University of Melbourne in Australia, and Virginia Murray, MBBS, of the UK Health Security Agency, said that the recommendations, along with the World Health Organization's Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025, \"provide crucial policy drivers to advance the digital health agenda and guide local stakeholders to establish digital health systems and protocols that facilitate future disaster health preparedness and emergency management\" (<https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789276>).\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n\r\n[\"A designated digital health agenda is bound to provide invaluable tools and insights to strengthen existing approaches to public health emergency management in relation to future epidemics and pandemics and, beyond that, preventing and managing the health risks and consequences of varied types of hazards and disasters.\" This is exactly the direction to be taken now to be better prepared for the next emerging pathogen. - Mod.LK]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[4] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 23 Feb 2022)\r\n\r\n[For technical reasons, the WHO update for 23 Feb 2022 is unavailable, and this section will be updated once it becomes available. - Mod.UBA]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[5] Global update: Worldometer accessed 23 Feb 2022 20:00 EST (GMT-5)\r\nDate: Wed 23 Feb 2022\r\nSource: Worldometer [edited]\r\n<https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries>\r\n\r\n\r\n[For those who wish to see the detailed global data, a snapshot of the Worldometer table at the time we accessed it is available at <https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WORLDDATA%20FEB23_1645817879.pdf>.\r\n\r\nA 7-day series of cumulative data reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at <https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20FEB23WORLD7_1645817897.pdf>. - Mod.UBA]\r\n\r\nTotal number of reported deaths: 5 936 712\r\nTotal number of worldwide cases: 430 193 456\r\nNumber of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours: 1 908 400\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[In the past 24 hours, 41 countries, including Germany (219 859), South Korea (170 006), Russia (137 642), Brazil (133 626), USA (101 841), Turkey (86 600), Viet Nam (81 856), Japan (77 810), France (66 833), Indonesia (61 488), Italy (49 162), Netherlands (40 569), UK (39 234), Austria (34 409), Spain (33 911), Malaysia (31 199), Denmark (27 473), Chile (25 200), Ukraine (25 062), Thailand (23 557), Australia (22 304), Poland (20 463), Singapore (20 312), Slovakia (19 075), Mexico (18 671), Switzerland (18 336), Norway (17 385), Greece (16 962), Iran (15 340), Czech Republic (14 353), India (14 148), R\u00e9union (13 632), Singapore (13 623), Hungary (13 261), Portugal (13 158), Argentina (12 564), Israel (12 410), Ireland (11 654), Romania (11 477), Latvia (11 320), and Georgia (10 230), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases.

The research, published in the journal Clinical Science, indicates blocking antibodies could represent a new treatment to alleviate cardiovascular complications.\r\n\r\nA multidisciplinary research team led by the University of Bristol, UK, analysed how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with heart cells causing the myocardial damage seen in COVID-19 patients. Until now, it remained unclear whether heart cells are infected by the virus or damaged because of an excess cytotoxic defence response.\r\n\r\nThis response, also known as the \"cytokine storm\", comes from our immune cells, whereby cytotoxic cells attack and kill the infected cells by releasing proteins called cytokines. The study also investigated whether heart cells contribute to producing excess cytokines.\r\n\r\nThe team led by Professor Paolo Madeddu exposed human heart pericytes, which are cells that wrap small blood vessels in the heart, to SARS-CoV-2 alpha and delta variants, along with the original Wuhan virus. They found the heart pericytes were not infected.\r\n\r\nIn a 2nd test-tube experiment, the researchers challenged the cardiac pericytes with only the spike protein -- which the virus uses to enter and infect the cells -- without the virus. The spike protein made pericytes unable to interact with their companion endothelial cells and induced them to secrete inflammatory cytokines, suggesting the spike protein is harmful to human cardiac cells. The team found that antibodies blocking CD147 -- a receptor for the spike protein -- protected heart pericytes from damage.\r\n\r\nThe findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can damage vascular cells without infecting them, according to the researchers. Cleaved spike protein particles could also amplify the damage induced by the engagement of the full virion with vascular cells, they added.\r\n\r\nThe researchers identified the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in blood samples obtained from COVID-19 patients. This opens the possibility that spike protein particles traveling through the circulation can reach a site distant from the respiratory system and cause systemic damage, they said.\r\n\r\n\"Pericytes are essential cells of the heart, although their role in maintaining the structural integrity of the coronary vascular tree has emerged only recently,\" said Elisa Avolio, the study's 1st author from the Bristol Medical School.\r\n\r\n\"Our ongoing research on human cardiac pericytes indicates these cells co-operate with coronary endothelial cells during healing from a heart attack,\" Avolio said. The study shows that the spike protein jeopardises this interaction and transforms pericytes into inflammatory cells.\r\n\r\nThe researchers noted that CD147 blocking antibodies could represent a new treatment to alleviate cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients. \"Microvascular complications are frequent and harmful in patients with COVID-19, with up to 11% of those hospitalised in intensive care units having myocardial damage or having suffered a heart attack,\" Professor Paolo Madeddu, from the Bristol Medical School, added. \"Furthermore, people with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases are more likely to die of COVID-19,\" Madeddu added.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[The citation, abridged abstract, and Discussion excerpt of the above study follow:\r\nAvolio E, Carrabba M, Milligan R, et al.

The capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect vascular cells is still debated. Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein may act as a ligand to induce non-infective cellular stress. We tested this hypothesis in pericytes (PCs), which are reportedly reduced in the heart of patients with severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Here we newly show that the in vitro exposure of primary human cardiac PCs to the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type strain or the alpha and delta variants caused rare infection events. Exposure to the recombinant S protein alone elicited signalling and functional alterations, including: (1) increased migration, (2) reduced ability to support endothelial cell (EC) network formation on Matrigel, (3) secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules typically involved in the cytokine storm, and (4) production of pro-apoptotic factors causing EC death.\"\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n----------\r\n\"Our study provides novel proof-of-concept evidence for S protein capacity to cause molecular and functional changes in human vascular PCs, either dependently or independently of the CD147 receptor (summarised in Figure 11 [available at study URL]).\" - Mod.LK]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] Canadian vaccine: plant-derived virus-like particles\r\nDate: Thu 24 Feb 24 2022 11:28 EST\r\nSource: CBC News [edited]\r\n<https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/medicago-s-homegrown-plant-based-covid-19-vaccine-approved-by-health-canada-1.6362745>\r\n\r\n\r\nMedicago's plant-based COVID-19 vaccine is now approved by Health Canada, which will soon give Canadians the option of getting a homegrown shot against SARS-CoV-2. Regulators announced the decision to allow its use for adults 18-64 years of age on Thursday [24 Feb 2022], making this the 6th vaccine approved in Canada, on the heels of Health Canada's approval of the Novavax shot last week.\r\n\r\nIn what the biopharmaceutical company calls a world first, the vaccine from Quebec City-based Medicago uses plant-derived, virus-like particles, which resemble the coronavirus behind COVID-19 but don't contain its genetic material. The shots also contain an adjuvant [AS03] from British-American vaccine giant GlaxoSmithKline to help boost the immune response. In December [2021], the companies reported high efficacy levels against infection as they geared up for regulatory approval.\r\n\r\nDubbed \"Covifenz,\" the 2-dose shot's overall efficacy rate against all virus variants studied was 71%, with a higher efficacy rate of 75% against COVID-19 infections of any severity from the delta variant, then dominant, according to data shared at the time in a press release.\r\n\r\nThe results followed a global, Phase 3, placebo-controlled study of the 2-dose vaccine that was launched last March [2021]. This was before the highly contagious omicron family of subvariants, including BA.1 and BA.2, began circulating, though the company has said the vaccine can be adapted as needed. \"While additional confirmatory data are needed, preliminary and exploratory data show that Covifenz produces neutralizing antibodies against the omicron variant,\" noted Health Canada in a statement.\r\n\r\nThe department has also placed terms and conditions on the authorization. Medicago must continue to provide information to Health Canada on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, \"including protection against current and emerging variants of concern as soon as it is available,\" the statement continued.\r\n\r\n\"We will, in the next several months, know how well our vaccine did against omicron,\" the company's medical officer, Dr. Brian Ward, told CBC News, citing ongoing company trials, which also include a study on a booster dose that's slated to start within weeks.\r\n\r\nIn October [2021], Canada signed a deal to buy 20 million doses of Medicago's vaccine, with an option for 56 million more. In a press release issued on Thursday [24 Feb 2022], the company stressed a commitment to providing its shots as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\"The approval of our COVID-19 vaccine is a significant milestone for Canada in the fight against the pandemic. We appreciate Health Canada's timely review,\" said Takashi Nagao, the company's president and CEO, in the statement. \"We're also grateful for the Government of Canada's support in the development of this new vaccine, and we are manufacturing doses to start fulfilling its order.\"\r\n\r\nGiven this huge influx of vaccines, Canada's deputy chief public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo said some of those expected Medicago supplies will be part of Canada's ongoing efforts to send doses abroad. \"Canada is committed to the global effort to supply vaccines across the world,\" he said during a press conference. Recommendations on the vaccine's use from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization are also expected in the weeks ahead, Njoo said.\r\n\r\nFor now, the vaccine is only authorized for use in adults 18-64 years of age, based on the data that were reviewed by Health Canada. \"There was limited enrolment of participants older than 65 years of age in the clinical trials because a large proportion of older individuals were already vaccinated,\" the department said in its statement. \"Medicago is currently gathering data in older individuals to support regulatory authorization for this age-group.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist based in Toronto, told CBC News the vaccine's approval is good news, even though it comes after the majority of Canadians are already vaccinated with 2 or more doses. \"Is this going to have a major impact on us here in Canada? Probably not. But there might be some individuals who choose to get vaccinated with a non-mRNA product,\" he said, referring to the shots offered by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.\r\n\r\nWhat's most hopeful, Bogoch added, is how plant-based technology could help future vaccine development. The process developed by Medicago uses the plant species _Nicotiana benthamiana_, a close relative of tobacco plants that is used for pharmaceutical development, largely because of the high number of viruses that can successfully infect it. \"This might be a pretty unique way to produce and scale vaccination,\" Bogoch said.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Lauren Pelley]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[Thanks to Helen Branswell (<https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell>) for the above report.\r\n\r\n\"Virus-like particles (VLPs) are virus-derived structures made up of one or more different molecules with the ability to self-assemble, mimicking the form and size of a virus particle but lacking the genetic material so they are not capable of infecting the host cell. Expression and self-assembly of the viral structural proteins can take place in various living or cell-free expression systems after which the viral structures can be assembled and reconstructed.

The pros of the VLP vaccines include (1) may produce a stronger immune response than regular subunit vaccines, and (2) production may be much faster than for whole virus vaccines. Cons include (1) ensuring stability and purification can add to production time, and (2) can be hard to produce in large quantities.\r\n\r\nRead Moon et al's study, Construction of SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles in plant, at <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-04883-y>. - Mod.LK]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] COVID mortality increase\r\nDate: Thu 24 Feb 2022 06:22 EST\r\nSource: CNN [edited]\r\n<https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/health/covid-deaths-now-younger-unvaccinated/index.html>\r\n\r\n\r\nPlummeting COVID-19 case counts across the United States are leading to lifted mask mandates and more conversations about steps toward normalcy -- but more people are dying of the coronavirus now than during most points of the pandemic.\r\n\r\nMore than 2000 COVID-19 deaths have been reported in the United States each day for the past month. Average daily deaths are falling, but from a very high point. They dipped just below that mark in recent days, to about 1900 on Monday [21 Feb 2022]; the federal holiday may have delayed reporting.\r\n\r\nBefore omicron became the dominant coronavirus strain in the United States, there were only about 100 other days when there were more than 2000 COVID-19 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\r\n\r\nThe only other time that deaths have been this high for this long was during the 1st winter surge, before vaccines were available. The omicron wave has also been deadlier for longer than the delta surge: In September [2021], when delta was dominant, average daily deaths topped 2000 for half as long.\r\n\r\nMore than 120 000 people in the United States have died of COVID-19 since omicron became the dominant variant in December [2021], and COVID-19 has accounted for more than 1 in 5 deaths reported in 2022.\r\n\r\nA common refrain early in the pandemic was that COVID-19 was most deadly for the elderly and people with certain health conditions. The people dying from COVID-19 now tend to be younger than before, and they're overwhelmingly unvaccinated, experts say.\r\n\r\n\"I've long since lost track of the number of people I've seen die of the disease, but the reality is that almost everybody who is critically ill, in the ICU or dying now remains unvaccinated. That has been true since the beginning. But in the beginning, people didn't have the opportunity to be vaccinated,\" said Dr. Stephen Threlkeld, medical director of the infectious diseases program at Baptist Memorial Health Care in Memphis. \"None of us taking care of COVID patients need CDC statistics or anyone else to tell us that because we simply see that reality play out every day and have for quite some time.\"\r\n\r\nBut the data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are clear. In December [2021], the risk of dying from COVID-19 was 14 times higher for unvaccinated adults than it was for adults who were fully vaccinated with their initial series. The gap was even larger when looking at those who also got their booster shot: 51 times higher.\r\n\r\nThroughout the pandemic, the majority of COVID-19 deaths have happened in hospitals. But that share is even larger now, as nursing homes have become less of a hotspot. In 2020, more than 1 in 5 COVID-19 deaths was in a nursing home. But in 2022, fewer than 1 in 10 deaths have been in nursing homes, according to provisional data from the CDC.\r\n\r\nVaccination rates are higher among older people in the US, leaving a larger share of younger, unvaccinated people at higher risk for severe outcomes. Nearly 90% of seniors 65 and older are fully vaccinated with their initial vaccine series, and about two-thirds of those eligible have gotten their booster shot. But less than two-thirds of adults under the age of 40 and less than one-third of children are fully vaccinated.\r\n\r\nAnd the vaccines are working. Seniors accounted for 81% of COVID-19 deaths in 2020, a number that dropped to 69% in 2021 and has stayed at 76% so far in 2022, despite the increased risk for breakthrough infection amid exponential community spread. \"The virus simply went to the fuel that it had remaining,\" Threlkeld said.\r\n\r\nRacial disparities in COVID-19 deaths persist, but have decreased over time. Black, Hispanic and American Indian people are still about twice as likely to die of COVID-19 than White people, but that risk has fallen from about 3 times higher at the end of 2020.\r\n\r\nAnd White people, who are less likely to be vaccinated than Hispanic people, have accounted for a growing share of deaths recently. An analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that early in the omicron surge, the death rate for Hispanic people remained lower than the rate for White people, but death rates among Black people rose.\r\n\r\nAnd as the virus spread rapidly throughout the country, social determinants of health have started to play a larger role in who becomes seriously ill and dies from COVID-19. \"Delta was much more deadly. But omicron is so widespread,\" said Dr. Faisal Masud, director of the critical care center at Houston Methodist.\r\n\r\nExtremely high transmission rates mean the virus is reaching everyone, but it's hitting those from disadvantaged neighborhoods especially hard, he said. These are the people who are more likely to be uninsured and who may delay care, leaving chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension untreated. \"Patients who start with poor health come at a disadvantage,\" he said.\r\n\r\nTexas has reported more COVID-19 deaths than any other state in the past week and is on track to soon outpace California in terms of total COVID-19 deaths. It's important to note the significant differences in health insurance rates and vaccination rates in the 2 states, Masud said. More than 70% of Californians are fully vaccinated, compared with about 60% of Texans, according to CDC data.\r\n\r\nOverall, the proportion of omicron cases that have resulted in deaths appears to be lower than the case-mortality ratio for delta. But it's a \"denominator phenomenon,\" Threlkeld said, meaning a lower percentage of a much larger number is still going to be large.\r\n\r\n\"I think that's what people have forgotten: Just because something is a little less likely in a given person to cause severe disease, there are so many more people who've contracted this infection that you're going to have a lot of people who are ill,\" he said. \"We've certainly seen a lot of unvaccinated people who've done very poorly.\"\r\n\r\n[Byline: Deidre McPhillips]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[See the source URL for graphs and figures.\r\n\r\nBut even as deaths increase, see the report on easing of pandemic mask guidelines in section [4] below.]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[4] Mask guidelines to be eased\r\nDate: Thu 24 Feb 2022\r\nSource: AP News [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://bit.ly/3peFlKT>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Biden administration will significantly loosen federal mask-wearing guidelines to protect against COVID-19 transmission on Friday [25 Feb 2022], according to 2 people familiar with the matter, meaning most Americans will no longer be advised to wear masks in indoor public settings.\r\n\r\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday [25 Feb 2022] will announce a change to the metrics it uses to determine whether to recommend face coverings, shifting from looking at COVID-19 case counts to a more holistic view of risk from the coronavirus to a community. Under current guidelines, masks are recommended for people residing in communities of substantial or high transmission -- roughly 95% of US counties, according to the latest data.\r\n\r\nThe new metrics will still consider caseloads but also take into account hospitalizations and local hospital capacity, which have been markedly improved during the emergence of the omicron variant. That strain is highly transmissible, but indications are that it is less severe than earlier strains, particularly for people who are fully vaccinated and boosted. Under the new guidelines, the vast majority of Americans will no longer live in areas where indoor masking in public is recommended, based on current data.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Zeke Miller]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[5] Regional update: ProMED-SoAs\r\n[A] Bangladesh\r\nDate: Thu 24 Feb 2022 16:52 BST\r\nSource: The Daily Star [edited]\r\n<https://www.thedailystar.net/health/disease/coronavirus/events-who/deaths-infections/news/covid-19-death-toll-bangladesh-crosses-29000-mark-2969531>\r\n\r\n\r\nAt least 1516 new infections were recorded and 10 people died from COVID-19 in 24 hours until 8:00 am today [24 Feb 2022], said a press release issued by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).

Accordingly, 1.1 million has not yet got their booster dose, which is alarming,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Over 80% of 202 deaths occurred within the last 7 days, was of senior citizens out of which the majority of them were suffering from chronic diseases. In addition, over 60% is of those who have either not got 2 doses or a booster dose,\" he pointed out.\r\n\r\nThus, Dr Ginige urged people above 60 years of age to get themselves boosted as it helps them not get complications which probably result in deaths.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Sheain Fernandopulle]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED-SoAs\r\n\r\n[Maps of Sri Lanka: <http://www.mapsopensource.com/images/sri-lanka-districts-map.gif> and <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701646,144>\r\n\r\nThe South Asia COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (<https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/>) as of 25 Feb 2022 at 02:16 GMT:\r\nCountry: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population\r\nIndia: 42 893 585 / 513 258 / 366\r\nBangladesh: 1 939 651 / 29 005 / 173\r\nPakistan: 1 505 328 / 30 114 / 132\r\nNepal: 976 512 / 11 931 / 398\r\nSri Lanka: 641 786 / 16 116 / 747\r\nAfghanistan: 173 047 / 7578 / 188\r\nMaldives: 168 124 / 294 / 529\r\nBhutan: 11 010 / 6 / 8\r\n\r\nOver the last 7 days, 113 350, 13 081, 8635, 1655, and 8735 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 244 098, 32 035, 19 120, 3382, and 8506 in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of sharp decline in cases in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal over the last 3 weeks, but almost a state of stability in Sri Lanka. The numbers of daily deaths along with the numbers of daily active cases are also substantially decreasing in these 4 most populous countries in South Asia -- India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. The daily case positivity against the number of people tested is now around 5.5% in Bangladesh, and only 1.2% in India as indicated in items [A] and [B] above. The total laboratory-confirmed cases recorded in Pakistan have now crossed an epidemiological landmark of 1.5 million.\r\n\r\nDue to sustained decline in new cases in India, on 15 Feb 2022, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in a letter to all states and union territories asked to end additional COVID-19 restrictions imposed to tackle the new surge (<https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/covid-19-restrictions-health-ministry-decline-in-cases-1913860-2022-02-16>).

This rate of mortality is around 3 times lower compared with the overall death rate of 1.20% recorded in India due to the disease as of today (25 Feb 2022) (<https://www.mohfw.gov.in/>), but 3.3 times lower compared with the death rate (1.32%) recorded on 21 May 2021, 2 weeks later from the highest number of total daily cases (414 433) recorded on 6 May 2021, during the peak of the previous surge in the country believed to be caused by the delta variant (<https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india/>).\r\n\r\nAn update on the omicron variant can be seen at <https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2021-update-on-omicron>.

As of 23 Feb 2022, 86.69% have received the 1st dose and 65.44% of the target population have received the 1st and 2nd doses.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2022; doi: <https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2804.211837>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n--------\r\nWe describe a patient in Argentina with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Although both coronavirus disease and HPS can be fatal when not diagnosed and treated promptly, HPS is much more lethal. This case report may contribute to improved detection of co-infections in HPS-endemic regions.\r\n\r\n[Case report]\r\nWe describe a case of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and Andes virus co-infection in central Argentina. The patient, a 22-year-old woman without relevant pathologic records, sought care at a local hospital in November 2020 for fever, headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal manifestations. A nasopharyngeal swab sample tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription PCR at the Instituto Biol\u00f3gico \"Tom\u00e1s Per\u00f3n\". The patient's clinical status worsened 5 days after the onset of fever, and she was admitted to the hospital. Clinical laboratory findings at admission indicated thrombocytopenia, high leukocyte count, lymphopenia, and elevated hepatic enzymes. Computed tomography revealed bilateral pleural effusion associated with interstitial infiltration, and capillary filtration with slight peripheral pulmonary ground-glass opacity.\r\n\r\nWithin a few hours after admission, the patient had onset of marked respiratory distress. She was then referred to the intensive care unit for orotracheal intubation and treated with ampicillin/sulbactam and azithromycin. The epidemiologic investigation established that the patient resided in a hantavirus-endemic area. Consequently, HPS was suspected, despite the COVID-19-positive diagnosis. According to the confirmation criteria used by the Hantavirus National Reference Laboratory, Andes virus infection was confirmed by the detection of specific IgM and IgG by ELISA and genomic viral RNA by quantitative reverse transcription PCR in blood.\r\n\r\nThe patient was extubated 3 days after the co-infection was confirmed, and progressed favorably. She was discharged from the hospital 20 days after onset of symptoms.\r\n\r\n[Conclusion]\r\nBecause the HPS incubation period is longer than that for COVID-19, we might speculate that hantavirus infection occurred before coronavirus infection. The respiratory distress syndrome appeared 5 days after the onset of fever, which coincided with the characteristic prodromal period described for HPS. This condition, during the incubation period of HPS, could have induced a higher susceptibility to COVID-19. Because HPS can evolve rapidly to respiratory failure in most patients with severe disease, resulting in high case-fatality rates, alerting health-care workers from HPS-endemic areas is warranted to detect co-infections in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, at least 2 genotypes of Andes virus can be transmitted person-to-person, and these species are prevalent in 2 of the 3 hantavirus-endemic regions of Argentina.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we detected co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Andes virus causing HPS in a patient from a hantavirus-endemic area. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of co-infection for patients originating, residing, or traveling in hantavirus-endemic areas.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[Mahmoud Orabi is thanked for submitting this report.\r\n\r\nThis case is an interesting example of the diagnostic challenge that a dual infection with 2 different pathogens can present, especially when early symptoms of each may be similar. Apparently, the patient came from an area in Argentina where Andes hantavirus is endemic, alerting attending physicians to this virus as a possible pathogen responsible for her illness and the presence of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the area suggesting SARS-CoV-2 virus as another. Effective laboratory support identified both of the pathogens involved in this case. - Mod.TY\n\nProMED map:\nArgentina: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701659,4>]\n\n[See Also:\nCOVID-19 update (38): virus shedding, Argentina, deaths, tests, WHO, global 20220203.8701225\r\nHantavirus - Americas (03): Argentina (CH) details 20220120.8700944\r\nHantavirus - Americas (02): Argentina (CH) 20220117.8700918\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nCOVID-19 update (415): USA, mortality risk, AstraZeneca, Argentina, WHO, global 20211204.8700049\r\nCOVID-19 update (178): evidence-based med, B.1.617.2 spread UK, Argentina, WHO 20210521.8374686\r\nCOVID-19 update (109): animal, Argentina, Italy, cat, dog, OIE 20210323.8262789\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nCOVID-19 update (506): Argentina (BA, SE) animal, cat, dog, OIE 20201125.7972283\r\nHantavirus - Americas (08): Argentina (CH) 20200616.7472877]\n.................................................ml/ty/may/ml"

The vaccination campaign has been suspended in both provinces. A statement has been issued by the Regional Director of WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Region, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, as well as by the United Nations in the country, condemning these attacks, expressing condolences to the families and underscoring that the provision of health and the safety of health workers at the forefront are paramount, and must be kept neutral to any geo-political situation anywhere. \r\n\r\nOur thoughts and prayers are both with the families and our teams on the ground at this time. [See section 2 below]\r\n \r\n- Last week, Malawi reported a WPV1 case in a 3-year-old girl in the capital, Lilongwe.

The first is the official confirmation of the WPV1 case in Malawi (see Poliomyelitis update (04): cVDPV2 (Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia), WPV1 Malawi 20220218.8701529 for an earlier report on this). The second is the reports of the 1st cases of cVDPV associated AFP cases with dates of onset in 2022, with cVDPV1 associated AFP reported from Madagascar and cVDPV2 reported from Nigeria. Looking at the total reported case counts for 2020 vs 2021, there were 140 cases of WPV1 in 2020 and 5 in 2021, a 96% reduction in WPV1 associated cases, while for cVDPV associated cases there were 1113 cases of cVDPV in 2020 and 635 in 2021, a 43% reduction in cases. \r\n\r\nInformation on the epidemiologic investigation findings of the WPV1 case in Malawi would be greatly appreciated. Did the child or child's family have known contact with travellers from Pakistan? As the virus was last seen in 2019 in Sindh province, did it continue to circulate under the radarscope in Pakistan or was it introduced to Malawi and circulate under the radarscope in Malawi...  \r\n\r\nA map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at <https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/>.

He said the attacks and assassinations were a violation of international humanitarian law. \r\n\r\nThe head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyeus, has also expressed his profound shock. Four of the health workers were women, he said in a post on Twitter. \"We extend our deepest condolences to their families and colleagues,\" he wrote, adding that health workers should not be targeted.\r\n\r\nThe UN Country Team was appalled by the brutality of the killings, noting that this was not the first time health workers have come under attack. \r\n\r\nLast year, 9 polio workers were killed during national polio vaccination campaigns.\r\n\r\nThese immunization exercises are a vital and effective way to reach millions of children to protect them against polio, the UN statement said, and depriving them of an assurance of a healthy life is inhumane. \r\n\r\n\"This senseless violence must stop immediately, and those responsible must be investigated and brought to justice. These attacks are a violation of international humanitarian law.\" The UN strongly condemns all attacks on health workers anywhere, stressing that delivery of health care is impartial. \r\n\r\nThe polio vaccination campaign in Afghanistan is supported by WHO, together with the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other partners.\r\n\r\nThey planned to target nearly 10 million under-5s across the country this month [February 2022], with 4 more rounds scheduled for the rest of the year [2022].\r\n\r\nDr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, said the suspension of the programme in Kunduz and Takhar provinces leaves thousands of children unprotected and exposed to a life-threatening disease that can result in permanent paralysis. In calling for an end to \"senseless attacks\" on health workers, Dr. Al-Mandhari pointed out that they are strictly forbidden in all faiths. \"These cowardly acts ultimately only harm innocent children who must be given every opportunity to live safe and healthy lives,\" he said. \"WHO condemns all attacks on health workers in the strongest terms and appeal to the Taliban Authorities to immediately identify and bring the perpetrators to justice.\"\r\n \r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[What can one say above and beyond what we've said previously. It's hard to fathom why healthcare workers are being targeted. As long as this type of violence continues, the probability of polio eradication remains seriously challenged.\r\n\r\nFor a map of Afghanistan showing provinces, see <https://www.guideoftheworld.net/afghanistan-map-provinces>. - Mod.MPP]\n\n[See Also:\nPoliomyelitis update (05): Guinea-Bissau, cVDPV, RFI 20220218.8701539\r\nPoliomyelitis update (04): cVDPV2 (Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia), WPV1 Malawi 20220218.8701529\r\nPoliomyelitis update (03): WPV1 (AFP Afghanistan), cVDPV2 (AFP; ES Djibouti) 20220212.8701429\r\nPoliomyelitis update (02): global cVDPV1 (ES Madagascar), cVDPV2 (multicountry), 2021 20220129.8701140\r\nPoliomyelitis update (01): WPV1 (ES), cVDPV1+2 (AFP) 2021, COVID 20220103.8700644\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nPoliomyelitis update (25): global cVDPV2 (multicountry) Pakistan violence 20211218.8700356\r\nPoliomyelitis update (24): Yemen, WHO, comment 20211211.8700196\r\nPoliomyelitis update (23): global (WPV1 Afghanistan, cVDPV2 Cameroon, Nigeria) 20211210.8700170\r\n\r\nPoliomyelitis update (22): global (WPV1 Afghanistan, cVDPV2 multicountry), IHR 20211129.8699938\r\nPoliomyelitis update (21): global (WPV1 Pakistan ES, cVDPV2 multicountry) 20210904.8644347\r\nPoliomyelitis update (20): global (WPV1, cVDPV2, cVDPV1), Gambia, Uganda 20210821.8612882\r\nPoliomyelitis update (19): global (cVDPV2) Gambia, Pakistan, RFI 20210813.8591368\r\nPoliomyelitis update (18): global (WPV1,cVDPV1,cVDPV2), Pakistan violence 20210808.8577968\r\nPoliomyelitis update (17): global(cVDPV1,cVDPV2 Uganda/Gambia) Pakistan, Nigeria 20210730.8557717\r\nPoliomyelitis update (16): global (cVDPV1, cVDPV2), Nigeria 20210722.8538466\r\nPoliomyelitis update (15): global (cVDPV2), Nigeria 20210715.8522150\r\nPoliomyelitis update (14): Global (WPV1 ES, cVDPV2, cVDPV1) 20210708.8505008\r\nPoliomyelitis update (13): global (cVDPV2 Nigeria, Egypt environmental sample) 20210702.8489890\r\nPoliomyelitis update (12): global (cVDPV2, WPV1 ES) 20210624.8473119\r\nPoliomyelitis update (11): global (cVDPV2), vaccinator violence 20210618.8456569\r\nPoliomyelitis update (10): Senegal, cVDPV2 20210614.8447598\r\nPoliomyelitis update (09): global (WPV1 ES, cVDPV2 AFP cases) RFI 20210611.8442001\r\nPoliomyelitis update (08): global (cVDPV2), Afghanistan 20210603.8421558\r\nPoliomyelitis update (07): global, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Somalia, WHO 20210527.8382587\r\nPoliomyelitis update (06): global, Africa 20210516.8363867\r\nPoliomyelitis update (05): global, Afghanistan campaign, Yemen 20210419.8313248\r\nPoliomyelitis update (04): global, WPV1, cVDPV 20210312.8242333\r\nPoliomyelitis update (03): global, WPV1, cVDPV 20210309.8236114\r\nPoliomyelitis update (02): global, WPV1, cDPV 20210222.8205197\r\nPoliomyelitis update (01): Pakistan, global (Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone) RFI 20210102.8064119\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nPoliomyelitis update (24): global (WPV1; cVDPV2) 20201229.8053858\r\nCOVID-19 update (77): global, polio vacc on hold, new countries, WHO 20200404.7182744\r\nPoliomyelitis update (01): global (WPV1, cVDPV2), Pakistan (KP, SD) 20200103.6869841\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nPoliomyelitis update (106): Pakistan (KP) RFI 20191231.6865382\r\nPoliomyelitis update (01): global 20190104.6241814\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nPoliomyelitis update (62): (Nigeria, Niger) cVDPV2 20181228.6226490\r\nPoliomyelitis update (01): global (Afghanistan) 20180105.5539242\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nPoliomyelitis update (47): Pakistan, global (Congo DR) 20171229.5526565\r\nPoliomyelitis (01): Pakistan (GB), global, RFI 20170314.4898724\r\nand other items in the archives]\n.................................................mpp/may/ml"

Ten of them have been shifted to hospitals in Vadodara, said officials. Of the 7 confirmed cases, 6 are children aged between 3 and 12 and the other a 22-year-old man.\r\n\r\nThe report sent to the state health department states that all 7 cases -- 4 from the area of Bhuravav and 1 each from Dharapura, Lunawada Road, and SRP group in Godhra -- have been tested for AFP as per the National Polio Surveillance Project (NPSP) guidelines.\r\n\r\nDr Minakshi Chauhan, chief district health officer (CDHO), Panchmahal district, told The Indian Express that stool samples of the suspected patients had been sent for testing. \"We are awaiting results of the samples. At this point, we cannot confirm if the cause of AFP is Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS - a rare neurological disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks part of its peripheral nervous system) but the symptoms appear to be so... We have begun surveillance work in the affected area of Godhra town where people are reporting muscle weakness and feeling of pins-and-needles, gastric issues and even paralysis of the lower body. It could have been caused by a bacterial or viral infection but we are yet to ascertain the exact cause.\"\r\n\r\nChauhan said that the 1st case in the district came to light on [Sat 19 Feb 2022] and the district department swung into action on Monday [21 Feb 2022] after more patients in the area reported symptoms, particularly children and youth. Chauhan added that although the condition is not contagious, the district administration is working at ascertaining the cause of the spread.\r\n\r\nOf the 7 confirmed cases, a 6-year-old from Godhra, who is currently admitted at the SSG hospital in Vadodara, is said to be stable. The district administration is now conducting a COVID-19 antibody test on children who have reported AFP symptoms to establish any link with coronavirus as the region had seen a surge during the 3rd wave in January [2022].\r\n\r\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) defines AFP syndrome as characterised by a \"rapid onset of weakness of an individual's extremities, often including weakness of the muscles of respiration and swallowing, progressing to maximum severity within 1-10 days.\"\r\n\r\nThe term 'flaccid' indicates the absence of spasticity or other signs of disordered central nervous system (CNS) motor tracts such as hyperlexia, clonus, or extensor plantar responses.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[An excellent fact sheet on GBS covering clinical and epidemiologic background information can be found at the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (<https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Guillain-Barr%C3%A9-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet>).\r\n\r\nGBS is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system with resultant sensory and motor losses. There is a very high recovery rate in past days cited as 90% without residual paralysis, but more recently cited as 70%. It has most often been identified temporally associated with an infectious process, usually gastrointestinal (campylobacter infections) or respiratory and following Zika virus infection. It has also been identified following a vaccination (see GBS following swine flu vaccination in 1976 at <https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/guillain-barre-syndrome.html>). Refer to the 'See Also' section of this report below to see the various infections and vaccinations associated with increases in GBS occurrence.\r\n\r\nPresenting symptoms include tingling in feet or hands followed by motor weakness resulting in walking difficulties. It can progress to involve the muscles of the diaphragm and require intubation to assist with breathing.\r\n\r\nGBS is often an alternative diagnosis for non-polio acute flaccid paralysis. And here's where the challenge comes in. In pre-eradication initiative years, oftentimes a polio outbreak was first called an outbreak of GBS. Hence the collection of specimens mentioned in the above media reports -- to rule out polio as the etiology of these cases of AFP. But adding to more recent challenges, GBS has been associated with COVID-19 -- following infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. One wonders if PCRs for viral DNA were also done in these cases.\r\n\r\nAn interesting finding while searching for more information on this outbreak was a report of a GBS outbreak in Gujarat, India in late October 2021 (see <https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-civil-hospital-guillain-barre-syndrome-cases-7591027/>). A different district but suggestive of something going on in the State.\r\n\r\nFor a map of Gujarat, India showing districts see <https://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/gujarat/gujarat.htm>. Note that the October 2021 report came from Ahmedabad in the north central region of the state, and Godhra is in Panchmahal in the north east of the state separated by one district from Ahmedabad.\r\n\r\nProMED would greatly appreciate receiving information on the results of the laboratory studies as well as the epidemiologic investigation.\r\n\r\nSelected references of interest:\r\n1.\tMartin Arias LH, Sanz R, Sainz M, Treceno C, Carvajal A.

We analysed reported cases, explored data reported to the WHO Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (GASP) and performed a review of publications on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in gonorrhoea in the period 2015 to 2020 using systematic methodology.\r\n\r\nResults: From 2015 to 2019, in most of the countries with 3 or more data points, there was a pattern of decrease in reported syphilis, gonorrhoea and chlamydia cases, which is in contrast to the EU/EEA. The number of reported cases per 100 000 population was 0.4-26.5 for syphilis, 0-18.5 for gonorrhoea and 0-43.3 for chlamydia. Four countries reported recent data on AMR in gonorrhoea to GASP, and we identified further publications from Georgia, Russia and Ukraine.\r\n\r\nConclusion: We found wide heterogeneity in reported rates of STI. There is a strong need to improve availability and quality of STI surveillance data in the non-EU/EEA countries.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n----------\r\nAmong the key findings of this analysis is a still rather limited availability of STI data, including AMR data in gonorrhoea, in tools that the WHO uses for STI data collection and reporting such as CDJRF [Europe Communicable Diseases Joint Reporting Form], GAM [Global AIDS Monitoring] and GASP. Moving forward, STI surveillance systems and laboratory diagnostics need to be further strengthened so as to better estimate the burden of STI, measure progress towards the STI control targets set by the WHO and guide the implementation of national STI control programmes. Specific to the European Region is the importance of availability of STI trend data in key populations, in particular in MSM [men who have sex with men] in the context of pre-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of HIV transmission and decreased condom use.\r\n\r\n[The full journal article is available at the source URL. - Mod.ML]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[The 18 non-EU/EEA countries include Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kazakhstan, North Macedonia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Russia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, plus Kosovo.\r\n\r\nFor 2015 to 2018, only 4 non-EU/EEA countries reported gonococcal AMR and susceptibility testing data for at least one drug, namely, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Ukraine, but AMR data for more than 100 gonococcal isolates in a year was available only from Russia in 2015 and 2016.\r\n\r\nEuropean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) data on syphilis in EU/EEA Member States for 2018 are available at <https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/syphilis-annual-epidemiological-report-2018>, on gonorrhea for 2018 at <https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/gonorrhoea-annual-epidemiological-report-2018>, and on gonococcal antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance for 2017 at <https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/gonococcal-antimicrobial-susceptibility-surveillance-europe-2017>. - Mod.ML\n\nProMED map:\nEastern Europe: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701666,22814>]\n\n[See Also:\nSyphilis - Denmark: increasing, men who have sex with men, 2019-21 20220214.8701456\r\nSyphilis - Ireland: rising incidence, RFI 20220109.8700752\r\nSyphilis - Russia: (BK) 20220107.8700715\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nSyphilis - Ireland: rising incidence, men, alert 20210712.8512672\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nSyphilis - Europe: ECDC, MSM, 2010-2017 20190715.6568104\r\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - UK: (Scotland) increase, MSM 20190531.6495958\r\n2016\r\n----\r\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, HIV - Ireland: rising incidence, MSM 20161017.4564211\r\nSyphilis - UK: (London) rising incidence, MSM, 2015 20160821.4430577\r\nSyphilis - Ireland: (CO,KY) rising incidence, MSM 20160806.4397832\r\nSyphilis, gonococcal dis, chlamydia - UK: (ENG) rising incidence, MSM, youth, 2015 20160706.4328717\r\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA (03): (CA) incr. incidence, 2015 20160620.4298962\r\nSyphilis, gonococcal disease, chlamydia - USA (02): (IL) incr. incidence, 2015 20160613.4283744\r\nSyphilis - Europe (02): Sweden (VG) incidence up, condom use down, MSM 20160527.4248388\r\nSyphilis - Europe: rising incidence, MSM, 2010-2014 20160520.4234775\r\nSyphilis & gonococcal dis. - Norway: incr. cases, MSM, heterosexuals, 2010-2015 20160502.4196049\r\nSyphilis - Ireland: rising incidence, MSM 20160407.4143479\r\nSyphilis - Iceland: rising incidence, MSM, 2015, RFI 20160115.3938913]\n.................................................sb/ml/rd/ml"

The study by an international team used updated excess mortality and fertility data to model increases in minimum estimates of COVID-19 orphanhood and caregiver deaths in 20 countries from 1 Mar 2020 to 31 Oct 2021. Orphanhood was defined as the death of one or both parents, and caregiver death included parental death or death of a custodial or co-residing grandparent. The team's original study had estimated that, from 1 Mar 2020 to 30 Apr 2021, 2 737 300 children had experienced a COVID death of a parent or caregiver.\r\n\r\nThe updated estimate found that, from 30 Apr 2021 to 31 Oct 2021, the number of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood or caregiver death increased 90%, from 2 737 300 children to 5 200 300 children. Over the entire 20-month period, 491 300 children aged 0-4 years, 736 800 children aged 5-9 years, and 2 146 700 children aged 10-17 years were estimated to have experienced COVID-19-associated orphanhood. Globally, 76.5% of those children lost a father, and 23.5% lost a mother.\r\n\r\nThe total number of orphaned children ranged widely across the 20 countries, from 2400 children in Germany to 1 917 000 children in India. Per capita, the highest rates of orphanhood were in Peru (8.28 per 1000 children) and South Africa (7.22).\r\n\r\nThe study authors say the data suggest the surge of parent and caregiver deaths \"must be urgently addressed with sustainable and scalable solutions, and integrated into coordinated and collaborative global, regional, and national strategies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such support should focus on 3 core components: preventing caregiver death through equitable COVID-19 vaccine coverage, containment, and treatment; preparing families that are safe and nurturing to support affected children (such as through kinship care, foster care, and adoption); and protecting children using evidence-based strategies to reduce risks of poverty, childhood adversity, and violence,\" coauthor Susan Hillis, PhD, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a Lancet press release (<https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/944436>).\r\n\r\n\"These strategies will help save lives now and put the programmatic and financial infrastructure in place on a global scale to secure a better future for children and families around the world.\"\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n[The citation and Interpretation section of the study appear below.\r\nCitation: Unwin HJT, Hillis S, Cluver L, et al.

Average healthcare wages rose at a lower rate than other industries (5.0% vs 6.7% in 2020 and 1.5% vs 6.9% in 2021).\r\n\r\nThe largest declines in employment in 2020 were in dentists' offices (10.0%) and SNFs (8.4%), while the smallest declines occurred in hospitals (2.5%) and physicians' offices (4.6%). Other healthcare sectors rebounded to prepandemic employment levels in 2021, but SNFs saw even more declines (13.6% relative to 2019) despite having the largest wage increases (9.5% in 2020 and 6.3% in 2021).\r\n\r\nThe adjusted 2020 SNF employment level relative to 2019 was 105.2% among counties with the lowest quintile of COVID-19 infections and 90.4% among those in the top 20%. Counties with the lowest physician-to-population ratios tended to have higher adjusted employment levels in physicians' offices (107.8% vs 97.9%) and dentists' offices (110.1% vs 98.4%).\r\n\r\n\"Future research is needed to understand if organizations are demanding fewer workers or fewer workers are willing to work at healthcare positions,\" the authors wrote. \"Overall, our results imply that intensified early efforts are needed to protect the healthcare workforce in future pandemics.\"\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] Mask guidance\r\n[A] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\r\nDate: Fri 25 Feb 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/02/cdc-eases-covid-19-mask-guidance-adds-metrics-future-use>\r\n\r\n\r\nAs expected and amid a steadily declining omicron surge, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today [25 Feb 2022] updated its indoor masking guidance, which would ease indoor use for most parts of the country, according to new baseline measures.\r\n\r\nThe CDC urges states and cities to still look at COVID-19 caseloads when considering masking. But it adds 2 new metrics for assessing whether to trigger the measure: hospitalization levels and hospital capacity.\r\n\r\nMost states have already dropped their mask mandates, reflecting a transition to voluntary use in people who want to lower their risk of spreading or contracting the virus. Hawaii as the only state with mandates still in place.\r\n\r\nThe move comes at the tail of a downslope of the nation's worst COVID-19 surge, fueled by the much more transmissible omicron variant. At a briefing today [25 Feb 2022], CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, said the updated guidance comes at a time when the risk is getting lower because of widespread immunity and added that the CDC has been considering shifting to the metric system for some time.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about potential political pressure from governors who have already phased out their mask mandates, Walensky said the guidance intersects with policies that are winding down.\r\n\r\nGreta Massetti, PhD, MPH, with the CDC's COVID-19 incident management team, said the guidance comes with a regularly updated map of the country that reflects the metric status, with a 3-tiered recommendation, ranging from low (vaccination and testing when sick), to medium (additional precautions for high-risk people), to high (everyone should wear a high-quality mask indoors). More than half of counties are currently in the low and medium ranges, down from one-third a week ago.\r\n\r\nCDC officials said their recommendation for schools are the same as for communities, signaling the end of a universal masking recommendation that the CDC has had in place since July 2021. They also emphasize that anyone who wants to reduce their risk of contracting the virus should feel free to use a mask.\r\n\r\nWalensky said no one knows what the future holds for the pandemic. \"We want to give people a break when levels are low with the ability to reach for them [masks] again.\" Today's new guidance doesn't apply to public transportation, for which a masking recommendation remains in place until at least 18 Mar 2022.\r\n\r\nIn other US developments, a new study from the CDC and its partners looked at household transmission of the omicron variant, finding the highest attack rates in instances where index patients weren't vaccinated and who didn't isolate or mask to limit the spread in their homes.\r\n\r\nThe study enrolled 183 households in 4 locations: Chicago, Milwaukee, Connecticut, and Utah. The study is based on telephone interviews with people with sequence-confirmed omicron infections and was published today [25 Feb 2022] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7109e1.htm>).\r\n\r\nUS COVID-19 markers continue to decline, with 65 491 cases reported yesterday [24 Feb 2022] compared with 84 793 the previous day, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard. Deaths, a lagging indicator, are declining slower and are still near the peak levels of the delta wave last fall [2021].\r\n\r\nParts of Asia continue to battle late omicron surges, with Hong Kong's cases topping 10 000 for the 1st time, reflecting another steep rise, according to the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (<https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202202/25/P2022022500683.htm>).\r\n\r\nSouth Korea's daily cases dipped below 170 000, but health officials don't expect daily cases to peak until the middle of March [2022]. The number of critically ill people spiked from 581 to 655 today [25 Feb 2022], and deaths have doubled over the past week, according to The Korea Herald, which cited data from Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (<http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220225000202>).\r\n\r\nElsewhere, New Zealand -- another part of the world experiencing a late surge -- reported a sharp rise in cases today [25 Feb 2022], with the new daily record topping 12 000. The daily total doubled from the day before (<https://www.1news.co.nz/2022/02/25/sharp-increase-sees-12011-new-covid-19-community-cases-in-nz/>).\r\n\r\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n\r\n---\r\n[B] STAT News\r\nDate: Fri 25 Feb 2022\r\nSource: STAT News [edited]\r\n<https://www.statnews.com/2022/02/25/cdc-issues-long-awaited-new-guidance-on-when-to-wear-masks/>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued long-awaited new guidance Friday [25 Feb 2022] on when Americans should consider wearing masks to protect themselves against COVID-19. Under the new guidance, roughly 70% of the US population can now contemplate removing their masks.\r\n\r\nThe guidance lays out a system that designates individual counties as being at either low, medium, or high risk from COVID-19. Roughly 62.6% of counties -- home to 71.7% of Americans -- fall into the low- and medium-risk categories.\r\n\r\nThe new system moves beyond sheer numbers of new cases to look at how well the healthcare system in each county is holding up. The idea, the CDC said, is to focus on minimizing severe disease and ensuring that hospitals are able to cope with COVID cases while still delivering standard care.\r\n\r\nThe designations will be based on key metrics at a county level, using data counties provide to the CDC on an ongoing basis. Those include the rate of COVID cases that require hospitalization and the percentage of beds in hospitals that are occupied by people who have COVID. If immunity from vaccination or prior infection holds and fewer people who contract COVID develop severe disease, more counties would move into the low-risk designation. But if a new variant emerges that causes more severe illness, rising hospitalizations would trigger a return to a recommendation to wear masks.\r\n\r\n\"None of us knows what the future may hold for us and for this virus. And we need to be prepared, and we need to be ready for whatever comes next,\" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said during a press briefing Friday [25 Feb 2022]. \"We want to give people a break from things like mask wearing when our levels are low, and then have the ability to reach for them again should things get worse in the future.\"\r\n\r\nMost people living in counties where the risk is designated as low or medium are not being urged to wear masks, though people who are at high risk from COVID-19 and who live in counties listed as being at medium risk should talk with their healthcare providers about whether they should wear a mask.\r\n\r\nPeople who live in counties where the risk is designated as high -- currently 28.2% of Americans -- should wear masks in indoor public settings, including schools, the guidance states. The guidance comes as jurisdictions across the country have lifted mask mandates or have announced plans to lift them.\r\n\r\nThough the guidance will give people in much of the country a green light to take off their masks in public settings, the CDC noted that they may choose to continue to wear masks. \"If you are more comfortable wearing a mask, feel free to do so,\" Walensky said.\r\n\r\nThe agency also noted that people who have tested positive for COVID, who have COVID-like symptoms, or who have been exposed to someone with COVID should wear a mask, regardless of the risk level in their county.\r\n\r\nThe new guidance also updates CDC recommendations on mask wearing in schools. Up until now, the agency has recommended that masks be worn in schools; with the new guidelines, the CDC is only recommending mask wearing in schools in counties that are designated high risk.\r\n\r\nUnder the new system, COVID-prevention recommendations for people living in low- and medium-risk counties are effectively that they should be vaccinated and boosted, and should get tested for COVID if they are sick with COVID-like symptoms. In the medium-risk settings, people who are immunocompromised or who have chronic health conditions should discuss the merits of mask wearing with their doctors.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Helen Branswell]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n---\r\n[C] AMA statement\r\nDate: Fri 25 Feb 2022\r\nSource: American Medical Association (AMA) [edited]\r\n<https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-statement-cdc-covid-19-updates>\r\n\r\n\r\nAMA statement on CDC COVID-19 updates\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nStatement attributable to:\r\nGerald E. Harmon, MD\r\nPresident, American Medical Association\r\n\r\nToday's [25 Feb 2022] updated recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reflect a new approach for monitoring COVID-19 in communities. Vaccines work; they are effective in preventing severe COVID, hospitalization and death. And we urge all Americans to stay up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccines, including getting a booster dose, when eligible.\r\n\r\nBut even as some jurisdictions lift masking requirements, we must grapple with the fact that millions of people in the United States are immunocompromised, more susceptible to severe COVID outcomes, or still too young to be eligible for the vaccine. In light of those facts, I personally will continue to wear a mask in most indoor public settings, and I urge all Americans to consider doing the same, especially in places like pharmacies, grocery stores, on public transportation -- locations all of us, regardless of vaccination status or risk factors, must visit regularly. Although masks may no longer be required indoors in many parts of the United States, we know that wearing a well-fitted mask is an effective way to protect ourselves and our communities, including the most vulnerable, from COVID-19 -- particularly in indoor settings when physical distancing is not possible.\r\n\r\nWearing a mask, physical distancing, and staying home if you're sick are small, but important protective measures that can help us all stay safe. While the omicron surge has declined, COVID-19 is not gone. We must remain adaptable and vigilant in confronting this unpredictable virus.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] Hong Kong: COVID surge\r\nDate: Thu 24 Feb 2022\r\nSource: Al Jazeera [edited]\r\n<https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/24/hong-kong-china-help-covid-surge>\r\n\r\n\r\nHong Kong has invoked emergency powers so that doctors and nurses from mainland China can join its efforts to fight what it said was a \"dire epidemic situation\" as the omicron variant of the coronavirus sweeps across the densely populated territory. Authorities on Thursday morning [24 Feb 2022] reported 8674 new cases, nearly all of them locally acquired.\r\n\r\n\"Hong Kong is now facing a very dire epidemic situation, which continues to deteriorate rapidly,\" the government said in explaining its need for the emergency powers. The outbreak is expected to \"continue to escalate exponentially and go beyond the epidemic control capacity\" of the territory's administration, meaning \"Hong Kong's healthcare system, manpower, anti-epidemic facilities and resources, etc will soon be insufficient to handle the huge number of newly confirmed cases detected every day.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chinese territory is one of the world's most densely populated places with many families living in tiny high-rise apartments that make it impossible for people to isolate themselves. It has been hit hard by the omicron wave, which slipped through the defences of its stringent quarantines and contact tracing that had kept the virus at bay since the pandemic began 2 years ago.\r\n\r\nThere have been nearly 50 000 cases confirmed over the past 14 days, and China's President Xi Jinping has told Hong Kong to take \"all necessary measures\" to suppress the outbreak. Hong Kong is building temporary medical facilities to help deal with the surge in COVID-19 cases amid resentment at its commitment to a China-style zero COVID policy.\r\n\r\nThe powers \"will provide a legal framework for the [government] to render the necessary emergent support to Hong Kong in a more effective and expeditious manner,\" the Hong Kong government statement said.\r\n\r\nThe territory has made its already tough restrictions even tougher as it tries to stamp out its worst outbreak of COVID-19 since the virus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan 2 years ago. It is also due to begin compulsory testing of its 7.4 million people next month [March 2022], part of the so-called \"dynamic zero COVID\" strategy that mimics mainland China's response to the virus.\r\n\r\nA group of mainland Chinese experts are currently in Hong Kong to advise on the pandemic response, and are helping in the construction of emergency medical facilities to cope with the expected influx of patients.\r\n\r\nDespite increasing resentment among Hong Kong residents at the government's draconian approach, a \"vaccine passport\" also came into force on Thursday [24 Feb 2022], with everyone aged 12 and older required to have at least one COVID-19 vaccination. People will need the pass to access a wide range of places, including supermarkets.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[Also read from AP News (<https://bit.ly/3HpL2vY>): \"The new daily case count reached 10 010, health officials said, after topping 6000 last week and 8000 earlier this week in a spiraling outbreak.

Nevertheless, sporadic cases, sometimes fatal, continue to be reported. \r\n\r\nAim: To report on diphtheria cases and coverage with 1st and 3rd doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccines (DTP1 and DTP3, respectively) for 2010-19 in the Region with a focus on 2019. \r\n\r\nMethods: Data on diphtheria cases were obtained from WHO/United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) Joint Reporting Forms submitted annually by the Region's Member States. WHO/UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage for DTP1 and DTP3 were summarised for 2010-19. For 2019, we analysed data on age, and vaccination status and present data by country on DTP1 and DTP3 coverage and the percentage of districts with \u2265 90% and < 80% DTP3 coverage. \r\n\r\nResults: For 2010-19, 451 diphtheria cases were reported in the Region. DTP1 and DTP3 coverage was 92-96% and 95-97%, respectively. For 2019, 52 cases were reported by 11 of 48 countries that submitted reports (including zero reporting). Thirty-nine countries submitted data on percentage of their districts with \u2265 90% and < 80% DTP3 coverage; 26 had \u2265 90% districts with \u2265 90% coverage while 11 had 1-40% districts with < 80% coverage. \r\n\r\nConclusion: Long-standing high DTP3 coverage at regional level probably explains the relatively few diphtheria cases reported in the Region. Suboptimal surveillance systems and inadequate laboratory diagnostic capacity may also be contributing factors. Still, the observed cases are of concern. Attaining high DTP3 coverage in all districts and implementing recommended booster doses are necessary to control diphtheria and prevent outbreaks.\r\n\r\n[The full journal article is available at the source URL. - Mod.ML]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Diphtheria is a potentially fatal disease caused by toxigenic strains of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _C. ulcerans_, or _C. pseudotuberculosis_, aerobic gram-positive bacilli that can cause respiratory tract or cutaneous diphtheria. Toxin production occurs only when the bacilli are infected (lysogenized) by a specific bacteriophage that carries the gene encoding the toxin. \r\n\r\nThe toxin is responsible for the major complications, myocarditis (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure), and neuritis (e.g., paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm). Non-toxin-producing strains may cause mild to moderate pharyngitis. Although either toxigenic or nontoxigenic strains can cause cutaneous diphtheria, toxic cardiac or neurologic manifestations are uncommon in cutaneous diphtheria, even when caused by toxigenic strains. Acquisition of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur even in vaccinated contacts, since vaccine-induced immunity is anti-toxin.\r\n\r\nHumans are the only reservoir of _C. diphtheriae_. Transmission of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cutaneous infections, and articles soiled with discharges from the respiratory tract or skin lesions. Travel to an endemic area is a risk factor for acquisition of _C. diphtheriae_. _C. ulcerans_ and _C. pseudotuberculosis_ cause zoonotic infection in humans (<http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/prevguid/m0051752/m0051752.asp>) and contact with a companion animal is a risk factor for acquisition of _C. ulcerans_. \r\n\r\nThe WHO data for diphtheria in the European region may be a mix of respiratory diphtheria and non-respiratory presentations of the disease, but most cases were said to be likely cases of respiratory diphtheria, since the WHO-recommended surveillance standards for diphtheria before their revision in 2018 focused specifically on respiratory disease presentation. Revised WHO-recommended surveillance standards recommended countries to expand the case definition of suspected diphtheria to include non-healing ulcers in a person with a travel history to countries with endemic disease or countries with diphtheria outbreaks. - Mod.ML\n\nProMED map:\nEurope: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701672,6010>]\n\n[See Also:\n2020\r\n----\r\nDiphtheria - UK: epidemiology 2009-2017 20200321.7122992\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nDiphtheria - UK: (Scotland) imported 20191110.6771386\r\nDiphtheria, cutaneous: travelers 20190512.6465807\r\nDiphtheria - Germany: toxigenic, cutaneous, siblings, suspected ex Somalia 20190111.6254250\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nC. diphtheriae - UK: toxigenic, cutaneous, ex Ghana, resp. diphtheria in contact 20180928.6058766\r\nDiphtheria - Ukraine (02): low vaccination rate 20180907.6012908\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nDiphtheria - Austria (02): cutaneous, tourist, comment 20170104.4740536\r\nDiphtheria - Austria: cutaneous, ex Sri Lanka, tourist 20170101.4736133\r\n2016\r\n----\r\nDiphtheria - Belgium: (AN) fatal, unimmunized child 20160321.4109267\r\n2015 \r\n----\r\nDiphtheria - Latvia (02): background 20151209.3850835\r\nDiphtheria - Latvia 20151208.3848321\r\nDiphtheria - Europe: cutaneous, refugees 20150815.3579462]\n.................................................sb/ml/may/ml"

The female patient, admitted to a hospital in Anand since the past week, is a resident of the Bamroli Road area in Godhra. The total number of GBS cases reported in Godhra now stands at 13. As many as 12 cases had come to light by Wednesday [23 Feb 2022] evening. The previous cases were reported from Bhuravav. \r\n\r\nThe reason for the GBS outbreak remains a mystery despite teams from Panchmahal district as well as SSG Hospital (SSGH) and CMERS, Gotri Hospital in Vadodara visiting the affected areas.\r\n\r\nAn official said that no immediate trigger has been identified for the cases. Sources said that GBS cases can be seen in a cluster in places that have faced an outbreak of some disease earlier. However, no such outbreak has come to light so far.

It can be triggered by acute viral or bacterial infections.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[It appears as though active surveillance has been implemented in the affected districts -- apparently in a seek and ye shall find mode.

The selected references below are a sampling of types of outbreaks of infectious diseases that have had clusters of GBS cases associated -- often identified as an increase in baseline incidence of GBS in the area.

    "content": "CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 UPDATE (60): ANIMAL, CHINA, ORIGIN, RESEARCH\n*********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Sun 27 Feb 2022\r\nSource: Nature News [edited]\r\n<https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00584-8>; <doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-00584-8>\r\n\r\n\r\nScientists have released 3 studies [see citations below] that reveal intriguing new clues about how the COVID-19 pandemic started. Two of the reports trace the outbreak back to a massive market that sold live animals, among other goods, in Wuhan, China, and a 3rd suggests that the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 spilled over from animals -- possibly those sold at the market -- into humans at least twice in November or December 2019. All 3 are preprints and so have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.\r\n\r\nThese analyses add weight to original suspicions that the pandemic began at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which many of the people who were infected earliest with SARS-CoV-2 had visited. The preprints contain genetic analyses of coronavirus samples collected from the market and from people infected in December 2019 and January 2020, as well as geolocation analyses connecting these samples to a section of the market where live animals were sold. Taken together, these different lines of evidence point toward the market as the source of the outbreak -- much like animal markets were ground zero for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002-2004 -- says Kristian Andersen, a virologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, and an author on 2 of the reports. \"This is extremely strong evidence,\" he says.\r\n\r\nStill, none of the studies contain definitive evidence about what type of animal might have harbored the virus before it spread to humans. Andersen speculates that the culprits could be raccoon dogs, a squat dog-like mammal used for food and for their fur in China. One of the studies he coauthored (Ref 2) suggests that raccoon dogs were sold in a section of the market where several positive samples were collected. And reports (Ref 4) show that the animals are capable of harboring other types of coronaviruses.\r\n\r\nSome virologists say that the new evidence pointing to the Huanan market doesn't rule out an alternative hypothesis. Namely, they say that the market could have just been the location of a massive amplifying event, in which an infected person spread the virus to many other people, rather than the place of the original spillover.\r\n\r\n\"Analysis-wise, this is excellent work, but it remains open to interpretation,\" says Vincent Munster, a virologist at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, a division of the National Institutes of Health, in Hamilton, Montana. He says searching for SARS-CoV-2 and antibodies against it in blood samples collected from animals sold at the market, and from people who sold animals at the market, could provide more definitive evidence of COVID-19's origins. The number of positive samples from the market suggests an animal source, Munster says. But he is frustrated that more thorough investigations haven't already been conducted: \"We are talking about a pandemic that has upended the lives of so many people.\"\r\n\r\nIn early January 2020, Chinese authorities identified the Huanan market as a potential source of a viral outbreak because the majority of people infected with COVID-19 at that time had been there in the days before they began to show symptoms, or were in contact with people who had. Hoping to stem the outbreak, Chinese authorities shuttered the market. Then researchers collected samples from poultry, snakes, badgers, giant salamanders, Siamese crocodiles, and other animals sold there. They also swabbed drains, cages, toilets, and vendor stalls in search of the pathogen. Following an investigation led by the World Health Organization (WHO), researchers released a report in March 2021 showing that all of the nearly 200 samples collected directly from animals were negative, but that more than 1000 environmental samples from the stalls and other areas were positive.\r\n\r\nA research team from China including the head of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has now genetically sequenced those positive samples, releasing the results in a preprint posted on 25 Feb [2022] [Ref 1]. The scientists confirm that the samples contain SARS-CoV-2 sequences nearly identical to those that have been circulating in humans. Further, they show that the 2 original virus lineages circulating at the start of the pandemic, called A and B, were both present at the market.\r\n\r\n\"It's a nice piece of work,\" says Ray Yip, an epidemiologist who is a former director of the China branch of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"They've confirmed that the Huanan market was indeed a very important spreading location.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the report from China posted online, Andersen and his colleagues rushed to post the manuscripts they had been working on for weeks.\r\n\r\nIn one [Ref 2], the team zeroed in on the southwestern section of the Huanan market, where live animals were sold as recently as 2019, as being the potential epicentre of the outbreak. They arrived at this conclusion by compiling information on the 1st known COVID-19 cases in China, as reported in various places, including the WHO investigation, newspaper articles, and from audio and video recordings of doctors and patients in Wuhan. This geospatial analysis found that 156 cases in December 2019 clustered tightly around the market and then gradually became more dispersed around Wuhan in January and February 2020.\r\n\r\nThey also examined the locations of the positive samples collected in the market, as reported in the WHO study, and fleshed out information about their potential surroundings by collecting business registration information, photographs of the market before it closed, and scientific reports that have emerged since the WHO's investigation. For example, one paper published last year [2021] [Ref 5] documented some 47 000 animals -- including 31 protected species -- sold in Wuhan markets between 2017 and 2019.\r\n\r\nIn one major finding in the new preprint, Andersen and colleagues mapped 5 positive samples from the market to a single stall that sold live animals, and more specifically to a metal cage, to carts used to move animals, and to a machine used to remove bird feathers. One of the coauthors on the report, virologist Eddie Holmes at the University of Sydney in Australia, had been to this stall in 2014 and snapped photographs -- included in this study -- of a live raccoon dog in a metal cage, stacked above crates of poultry, with the whole assembly sitting atop sewer drains. Notably, in the study from the China CDC, sewage at the market tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.\r\n\r\nIn a 2nd report [Ref 3], Andersen and colleagues concluded that lineage A and lineage B of SARS-CoV-2 are too different from one another on a genetic level for one to have evolved into the other quickly in humans. Therefore, they suggest that the coronavirus must have evolved within non-human animals and that the 2 different lineages spread to humans separately. Because lineage B was the far more prevalent variety in January 2020, among other reasons, the authors suggest that it spilled over into humans before lineage A. Other outbreaks of coronaviruses, such as the SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics, also resulted from repeated introductions from wildlife, the paper notes.\r\n\r\nTaking all of the new data together, and adding a degree of speculation, Andersen suggests that raccoon dogs could have been infected on a farm that then sold the animals at the markets in Wuhan in November or December 2019, and that the virus might have jumped to people handling them, or to buyers. At least twice, those infections could have spread from an index case to other people, he says.\r\n\r\nOver the past year, Michael Worobey, a virologist at the University of Arizona, in Tucson, and an author on the papers with Andersen [Refs 2,3], says that his thinking on the origins of COVID-19 has shifted. Back in May 2021, he led a letter published in Science [Ref 6] in which he and other researchers pressed the scientific community to keep an open mind about whether the pandemic stemmed from a laboratory, a controversial hypothesis suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 was either created in a lab, or was accidentally or intentionally released by researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. \"You want to take this kind of thing seriously,\" he explains. But since May, additional evidence has come to light that supports a zoonotic origin story similar to that of HIV, Zika virus, Ebola virus, and multiple influenza viruses, he says. \"When you look at all of the evidence, it is clear that this started at the market.\" Separate lines of analysis point to it, he says, and it's extremely improbable that 2 distinct lineages of SARS-CoV-2 could have been derived from a laboratory and then coincidentally ended up at the market.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, Munster says he is not completely convinced of 2 spillover events because, alternatively, the virus might have evolved from one lineage into the other within a person who was immunocompromised. He adds that more data collected from people and animals is needed to answer this question, and to show that the 1st spillover occurred at the Huanan market. David Relman, a microbiologist at Stanford University in California, agrees that the preprints are not definitive, and that they exclude the possibility that people were infected prior to the outbreak at the market, but went undiagnosed.\r\n\r\nHolmes fears that additional samples from early human cases and from animals might never materialize. Last July [2021], for example, Chinese officials said that they planned to analyse patient blood samples from 2019, stored at the Wuhan Blood Centre, but if that study has been conducted, it has yet to be made public. \"This is as good as it gets,\" Holmes says. \"What we should focus on now is trying to keep these events from happening again.\"\r\n\r\n[The above-mentioned references are below, including abstracts (abridged) for the 3 new studies.]\r\n\r\n[Byline: Amy Maxmen]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by\r\nProMED\n\n[References\r\n-----------\r\n1.

By SARS-CoV-2-specific RT-qPCR, 73 environmental samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 3 live viruses were successfully isolated. The viruses from the market shared nucleotide identity of 99.980% to 99.993% with the human isolate CoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01. In contrast, no virus was detected in the animal swabs covering 18 species of animals in the market. The SARS-COV-2 nucleic acids in the positive environmental samples showed significant correlation of abundance of _Homo sapiens_ with SARS-CoV-2. In summary, this study provided convincing evidence of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Huanan Seafood Market during the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak.\"\r\n\r\n2.

This distribution cannot be explained by high densities of elderly people at greater risk of symptomatic COVID-19. This pattern was stronger in cases without, rather than with, identified epidemiological links to the Huanan market, consistent with SARS-CoV-2 community transmission starting in the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nBy combining spatial and genomic data, we show that both the 2 early lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have a clear association with the Huanan market.\r\n\r\nWe also report that live mammals, including raccoon dogs, were sold at the market in late 2019, and geospatial analyses within the market show that SARS-CoV-2-positive environmental samples were strongly associated with vendors selling live animals.\r\n\r\nTogether, these analyses provide dispositive evidence for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 via the live wildlife trade and identify the Huanan market as the unambiguous epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\r\n\r\n3.

Zenodo. 2022 (preprint); <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6291628>.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\"Abstract\r\n------\r\nHere, we analyze the pattern and origin of genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 early in the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity prior to February 2020 comprised only 2 distinct viral lineages -- denoted A and B -- with no transitional haplotypes. Novel phylodynamic rooting methods, coupled with epidemic simulations, indicate that these 2 lineages were the result of at least 2 separate cross-species transmission events into humans. The 1st zoonotic transmission likely involved lineage B viruses and occurred in late-November/early-December 2019 and no earlier than the beginning of November 2019, while the introduction of lineage A likely occurred within weeks of the 1st event. These findings define the narrow window between when SARS-CoV-2 first jumped into humans and when the 1st cases of COVID-19 were reported. Hence, as with SARS-CoV-1 in 2002 and 2003, SARS-CoV-2 emergence likely resulted from multiple zoonotic events.\"\r\n\r\n4. He W-T, Hou X, Zhao J, et al.

However, on 9 Jan 2020, 'a scholar close to the expert group told the reporter of Caijing that the wild animals sold in the South China Seafood Market are currently under inspection to track down the source of the virus' (<http://tech.sina.com.cn/roll/2020-01-09/doc-iihnzahk3089851.shtml> [in Chinese]; included in 20200110.6881082, item [2]). It may be concluded that the closing of the market (on Wed 1 Jan 2020) followed the 'disposal' of the market's animals (on 31 Dec 2019?).\"\r\n\r\n\"Information on the following issues is still pending:\r\n1. Which (domestic/wildlife) animal species are known to have been present on the market on 31 Dec 2019 and/or 1 Jan 2020?\r\n2. What was the fate of the animals above? In case killed, details on the mode of disposal and quantitative data are requested.\r\n3. Was sampling of (any of) the market's animals, in vivo/in vitro, performed?\r\n4. In case sampled, which lab tests have been applied? if affirmed, results, per species, negative included, are requested.\r\n5. Were the (state/local) Veterinary Services involved throughout the procedures above?\r\n\r\n\"A One Health approach would prescribe when a public health event is suspected to be zoonotic, an integrated effort of the public and animal health establishments.\"\r\n\r\nThe above questions, republished in later postings, have remained unanswered to present, which means that the animals (such as raccoon dogs and Chinese bamboo rats) likely to have been kept in the market on the day of its closure might have been allowed to be removed on that day or earlier. In any event, they were not examined/sampled, alive or dead. This lacune deserves to be kept in mind when lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic are eventually drawn and guidelines, in the spirit of One Health, established.\r\n\r\nThanks are due to Mary Marshall for bringing an earlier media report on the new research papers to our attention. - Mod.AS\r\n\r\nProMED map of Hubei Province, China: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701690,340>\n\nProMED map:\nHubei Province, China: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701690,340>]\n\n[See Also:\n2021\r\n----\r\nCOVID-19 update (200): animal, China, origin 20210608.8433657\r\nCOVID-19 update (118): animal, China, origin, WHO mission, report 20210331.8279475\r\nCOVID-19 update (102): China, origin, farmed wild animals susp. 20210316.8251684\r\nCOVID-19 update (99): China, animal reservoir, wildlife sale, pork supply impact 20210315.8249619\r\nCOVID-19 update (65): animal, China, origin, WHO mission, Huanan market 20210214.8190188\r\nCOVID-19 update (60): animal, SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, pangolin, bat 20210211.8184900\r\nCOVID-19 update (58): animal, China, origin, WHO mission 20210210.8183343\r\nCOVID-19 update (43): animal, China, origin, WHO mission, Huanan market 20210201.8153415\r\nCOVID-19 update (41): animal, China, origin, WHO experts mission, visits start 20210130.8149337\r\nCOVID-19 update (27): animal, China, origin, WHO experts mission 20210121.8124456\r\nCOVID-19 update (17): animal, China, origin, WHO experts mission 20210114.8103327\r\nCOVID-19 update (07): animal, China, origin, WHO experts mission 20210106.8079009\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nCOVID-19 update (518): virus origin, placebo trials, vaccine, WHO, global 20201204.7991767\r\nCOVID-19 update (512): origins, testing regimens, WHO, global 20201129.7979451\r\nCOVID-19 update (389): origin of virus, face shields, selected countries, WHO, global 20200904.7745592\r\nCOVID-19 update (312): China, SARS-CoV2 origin, animal reservoir, WHO mission 20200711.7565035\r\nCOVID-19 update (17): China, animal reservoir, wildlife trade & consumption ban 20200225.7024245\r\nCOVID-19 update (11): animal reservoir, intermediate hosts, pangolin susp. 20200220.7009213\r\nCOVID-19 update (08): companion animals, RFI 20200218.7002276\r\nCOVID-19 update (06): animal reservoir, intermediate hosts 20200217.6997782\r\nNovel coronavirus (42): China, global, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, WHO 20200211.6979942\r\nNovel coronavirus (40): animal reservoir, pangolin possible intermediate host, RFI 20200210.6972104\r\nNovel coronavirus (28): China (HU) animal reservoir 20200201.6943858\r\nNovel coronavirus (22): reservoir suggested, bats 20200129.6930718\r\nNovel coronavirus (20): China, wildlife trade ban 20200127.6922060\r\nNovel coronavirus (18): China (HU) animal reservoir 20200125.6915411\r\nNovel coronavirus (15): China (HU) wild animal sources 20200123.6909913\r\nNovel coronavirus (03): China (HU) animal reservoir suggested, RFI 20200114.6887480\r\nNovel coronavirus (01): China (HU) WHO, phylogenetic tree 20200112.6885385\r\nUndiagnosed pneumonia - China (HU) (07): official confirmation of novel coronavirus 20200108.6878869\r\nUndiagnosed pneumonia - China (05): (HU) novel coronavirus identified 20200108.6877694\r\nUndiagnosed pneumonia - China (01): (HU) wildlife sales, market closed, RFI 20200102.6866757\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nUndiagnosed pneumonia - China (HU): RFI 20191230.6864153]\n.................................................arn/tw/ml"

Complaints included 3 reports of _Cronobacter sakazakii_ infections and one report of _Salmonella [enterica_] Newport infection in infants. All infants were hospitalized, and there was one death.\r\n\r\nAbbott issued a voluntary recall of powdered infant formula from Similac, Alimentum, or EleCare with the following product codes, which can be found on the container: the 1st 2 digits of the code are 22 through 37, and the code contains K8, SH, or Z2, and the expiration date is 1 Apr 2022 (APR 2022) or later. These products are widely distributed across the USA and other countries. Formulas matching the codes provided above could be contaminated with _Cronobacter_. These bacteria can cause severe foodborne illness in infants with newborns being especially high risk.\r\n\r\n\"Parents and caregivers with infants on formula should immediately review the formula to ensure they are not using a recalled product,\" said Dr. Ayne Amjad, state health officer and commissioner of DHHR's Bureau for Public Health. \"They should seek immediate medical care if their infant has consumed recalled formula and is experiencing signs and symptoms of _Cronobacter_ or _Salmonella_ infection: diarrhea, poor feeding, irritability, vomiting, or blood in their stool.\"\r\n\r\nParents and caregivers with a sick infant who has consumed a recalled product are encouraged to keep opened or unopened cans of recalled formula in the instance that the local health department would like to sample the product.\r\n\r\n_Cronobacter_ bacteria can cause severe, life-threatening infections such as sepsis or meningitis. Symptoms of sepsis and meningitis include poor feeding, irritability, temperature changes, jaundice, grunting breaths, and abnormal movements. _Cronobacter_ infection may also cause bowel damage and may spread through the blood to other parts of the body. Parents or caregivers noticing any of these symptoms in their children should seek immediate medical care.\r\n\r\nProducts that do not contain the information listed above are not impacted by this advisory. This advisory does not include liquid formula products or any metabolic deficiency nutrition formulas.\r\n\r\nHealthcare providers and health departments are encouraged to report any confirmed cases of _Cronobacter_ or _Salmonella_ who consumed a recalled product to the DHHR's Office of Epidemiological and Preventive Services at 304-558-5358, extension 2.\r\n\r\nFamilies who purchase infant formula with WIC benefits should reach out to their WIC clinic to return any open or unopened recalled products. WIC clinics must verify the products prior to replacing WIC benefits.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Several clusters of cases of infection with _C. sakazakii_ linked to contaminated powdered infant formula have been reported in the past. This cluster appears to have dual contamination with this organism and _Salmonella_ Newport.\r\n\r\n_Cronobacter sakazakii_ is a facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacillus that belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family. The organism has been implicated in neonatal intensive care unit outbreaks of meningitis, septicemia, and necrotizing enterocolitis, particularly in preterm infants, although infections due to _C. sakazakii_ can occur in older infants, children, and adults.\r\n\r\nThe association of neonatal infection due to _C. sakazakii_ with the use of powdered infant formula is not new. ProMED has previously reported on infection associated with powdered infant formula contaminated by _C. sakazakii_ (formerly called _Enterobacter sakazakii_) as seen in the \"See Also\" section below.\r\n\r\nThe organism has been associated with a number of different kinds of powdered formulas from many different countries, including the USA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _Enterobacter sakazakii_ infections associated with the use of powdered infant formula - Tennessee, 2001. MMWR. 2002; 51(14): 297-300).\r\n\r\nGenotyping has shown that patient and formula isolates shared the same typing pattern (Clark N C, Hill B C, O'Hara C M, et al. Epidemiologic typing of _Enterobacter sakazakii_ in 2 neonatal nosocomial outbreaks. Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 1990; 13(6): 467-72; doi: 10.1016/0732-8893(90)90078-a).\r\n\r\n_Cronobacter_ are frequently isolated from the environment, plant material (wheat, rice, herbs, and spices) and various food products. Ingredients, such as starches from wheat and rice, can be a source of _Cronobacter_ that have been found to contaminate powdered infant formula.\r\n\r\nBecause powdered infant formulas are not necessarily sterile and may contain pathogenic bacteria, recommendations have been made concerning preparation and handling of these products (Agostoni C, Axelsson I, Goulet O, et al.

COLI EHEC - FRANCE: HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME, FATAL\n*******************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Fri 25 Feb 2022\r\nSource: Notre Temps [in French, trans.

Thirteen cases in children aged 1 to 15 occurred in the regions of New Aquitaine (5 cases), Hauts-de-France (3 cases), Ile-de-France (3 cases), Brittany (1 case), and Pays de the Loire (1 case), the public Health agency France indicated on Friday evening, 25 Feb 2022.\r\n\r\n\"A child has died,\" added the health agency, which has not specified the date of death or the age of the child. All these children were affected by hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). This disease, whose origin is most often food, is potentially serious for young children: it is a complication of an episode of often bloody diarrhea, which can cause acute renal failure. It is frequently caused by bacteria belonging to the _Escherichia coli_ family.\r\n\r\nThe investigation, which covers all cases of pediatric HUS reported since early January (31 so far), aims to \"identify a possible common source of infection and put in place appropriate measures.\"\r\n\r\n\"At this stage, the epidemiological investigation is not excluding  any leads\", indicates Public Health France. Several sources of potential contamination are being explored: ingestion of contaminated food eaten raw or undercooked, contamination by soiled hands put in the mouth after touching animals carrying the bacteria or their contaminated environment, or contact with a sick person who excretes the bacteria in their stool.\r\n\r\nEach year, between 100 and 165 children with hemolytic uremic syndrome are notified to Public Health France, which has set up a surveillance system for this disease since 1996, according to the press release.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n\n[In general, outbreaks of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ do not have HUS as a complication in any more than 10%. If there are 13 cases of HUS, many more cases of the Shiga toxin-producing _E coli_ likely occurred.  The vehicle or vehicles for transmission are not stated.\r\n\r\nThe following by Joseph et al. is a good basic review on HUS:\r\nJoseph A, Cointe A, Kurkdjian P M, et al. Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome: a narrative review. Toxins. 2020; 12(2): 67; <https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins12020067>.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAbstract\r\n--------\r\n\"The severity of human infection by one of the many Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) is determined by a number of factors: the bacterial genome, the capacity of human societies to prevent foodborne epidemics, the medical condition of infected patients (in particular their hydration status, often compromised by severe diarrhea), and by our capacity to devise new therapeutic approaches, most specifically to combat the bacterial virulence factors, as opposed to our current strategies that essentially aim to palliate organ deficiencies. The last major outbreak in 2011 in Germany, which killed more than 50 people in Europe, was evidence that an effective treatment was still lacking. Herein, we review the current knowledge of STEC virulence, how societies organize the prevention of human disease, and how physicians treat (and, hopefully, will treat) its potentially fatal complications. In particular, we focus on STEC-induced hemolytic and uremic syndrome (HUS), where the intrusion of toxins inside endothelial cells results in massive cell death, activation of the coagulation within capillaries, and eventually organ failure.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding EHEC O80, Soysal et al (1) brought forth more information regarding this hybrid EHEC which contains a rare variant of the intimin gene and genetic determinants related to a plasmid, found mostly in avian pathogenic _E. coli_ and _E. coli_ that causes human neonatal meningitis, which is associated with extraintestinal virulence. This group, led by Stephane Bonacorsi, originally reported this atypical organism in an adult associated with HUS with a relapse associated with bacteremia (2).\r\n\r\nThe 2016 study reported that 96% of the cases were associated with HUS, but the authors do point out that the surveillance system for EHEC is voluntary in France, and PCR assays for Shiga toxin in stool are done only in cases involving diarrhea with HUS suspicion, so the denominator of total O80:H2 cases is not known. Likewise, whether this organism is zoonotic is also not clear, and the areas in France with this strain are not where most cases of _E. coli_ O157 are reported.\r\n\r\nRegarding the use of antimicrobials and O80, the issue is relevant in these cases because some of them are associated with bacteremia, which requires antimicrobial therapy. Azithromycin and ceftriaxone were not associated with increasing Shiga toxin production, whereas ciprofloxacin was in this study. In the large _E. coli_ O104:H4 outbreak in northern Germany, therapy was also used especially in those cases where the colon was perforated. In those reports, the carbapenem antimicrobials also did not increase toxin production. Whether these effects are strain specific is not clear at this time so should not necessarily be generalized to all EHEC. Of note, the _E. coli_ O104:H4 strain was a genetic hybrid between EHEC and enteroaggregative _E. coli_ and was not thought to be a zoonosis.\r\n\r\nExtraintestinal invasive strains of EHEC will indeed introduce another layer of concern about these infections.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n1.

The cases span multiple households, infecting school-age children and adults, including a person experiencing homelessness. Officials believe the bacteria may have been spread through one or more Eureka laundromats after an infected person washed contaminated clothing at the facility.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Health officials are working closely with the operators of the 2 laundromats, the Self-Serve Laundromat on Summer Street and Eureka Laundromat on Little Fairfield Street, to make sure their facilities are cleaned and disinfected properly.\r\n\r\n_Shigella_ bacteria are found in stool, and infection is spread by eating food or drinking liquids contaminated by an infected person, or when a person touches a contaminated surface or object and then touches their mouth or puts the object into their mouth. People infected with shigellosis typically experience a fever, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea, which may be bloody. Onset of shigellosis symptoms usually occurs 1-2 days after exposure -- but may take longer -- and lasts around a week. Most people with shigellosis recover completely without severe complications. In rare cases, _Shigella_ may cause bloodstream infections, seizures, kidney failure, or arthritis.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[In late 2021, an outbreak of shigellosis occurred in San Diego County in Southern California. This cluster is in Humboldt County, which is in the far north of the state.\r\n\r\n_Shigella_ was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10-100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices commoner in men who have sex with men. Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.\r\n\r\nThe bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux), an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing diarrhea). - Mod.LL\r\n\r\nProMED map of Humboldt County, California, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701699,6193>]\n\n[See Also:\n2021\r\n----\r\nShigellosis - USA (06): (CA) homeless individuals 20211222.8700434\r\nShigellosis - USA (05): (CA) homeless individuals 20211113.8699654\r\nShigellosis - USA (04): (CA) homeless individuals 20211026.8699278\r\nShigellosis - USA (03): (CA) homeless individuals 20211012.8699003\r\nShigellosis - USA (02): (KS) wildlife park, non-zoonotic, RFI 20210811.8587171\r\nShigellosis - USA: (KS) wildlife park, RFI 20210630.8486452\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nShigellosis - India: (KL) 20201226.8048430\r\nShigellosis - Denmark: fresh mint 20201017.7867256\r\nShigellosis - China: (AH) waterborne 20200825.7712409\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nShigellosis - USA: (Guam) 20190319.6375402\r\nFoodborne illness - Mongolia: (UB) fast food chain, shigellosis susp. 20190219.6325716\r\nShigellosis - Israel: (BS) preschoolers 20190126.6278982\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nShigellosis, st sonnei - USA: (VT) retirement community, multidrug resistant 20181107.6132342]\n.................................................sb/ll/tw/ml"

According to the report published this week by the ECDC, the United Kingdom Health Security Agency reported an increase in these infections at the end of January [2022] [<https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Shigella-infections-MSM-Feb-2022.pdf>] [Also see ProMED-AMR post Shigellosis - UK: Shigella sonnei, multidrug resistant clone, MSM 20220131.8701181].

Rapid Risk Assessment. Increase in extensively-drug resistant _Shigella sonnei_ infections in men who have sex with men in the EU/EEA and the UK. 23 Feb 2022. <https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Shigella-infections-MSM-Feb-2022.pdf>\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n-------\r\n\"On 27 Jan 2022, the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reported an increase in extensively- drug resistant _Shigella sonnei_ infections. Since then, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and Spain have reported cases of shigellosis with sampling dates from 2020 to 2022 and with isolates either closely genetically related by whole genome sequencing (WGS), or with the same or a very similar resistance profile. Most cases were in adult men who have sex with men (MSM). A large proportion of the patients with available information were reported to be infected through sexual transmission.\r\n\r\nRisk assessment\r\n---------------\r\n\"This document assesses the risk of further spread of _S. sonnei_ amongst MSM and in the broader population in EU/EEA countries, resulting from the current increase in extensively-drug resistant _S. sonnei_ infections.\r\n\r\n\"Sexual contact networks among some MSM in Europe are highly interconnected, sometimes involving high-risk sexual practices often involving anonymous sexual contacts. The probability of new infections in MSM exposed to high-risk sexual practices, and the spread in EU/EEA countries in the coming months is assessed as high, as outbreaks among MSM usually occur over long time periods. If the lifting of restrictions related to the COVID- 19 pandemic is also considered, travel and the number of social events will likely increase as well. The impact of such infections is assessed as low in most instances as _S. sonnei_ is generally associated with mild disease in healthy adults. However, the impact of the infection could be more severe in immunocompromised adults. In addition, the resistance profile of this strain limits treatment options, whether this is aimed at shortening shedding in mild cases or treating severe cases. Based on these levels of probability and impact, the level of risk for MSM is assessed as moderate.\r\n\r\n\"Opportunities for infection in the non-MSM population increase when transmission among MSM is high. Currently, there have been very few reports of non-MSM cases associated with the ongoing increase of cases of extensively-drug resistant _S. sonnei_. The probability of infections in the broader population, including the probability of foodborne outbreaks associated with infected food handlers, is assessed as very low. The impact of such infections is assessed as low in most instances, due to a generally mild disease in healthy individuals. Consequently, the level of risk for the broader population is assessed as low.\r\n \r\nOptions for response\r\n--------------------\r\n\"Men who have sex with men should aim to minimise the risk of infection through faecal-oral exposure during sexual activity by practicing safe sex and good hygiene. MSM presenting symptoms of gastrointestinal illness are recommended to get tested for gastrointestinal pathogens and other STIs and to inform the treating physician about the infection risk through sexual activity. Sexual activity should be avoided for at least 7 days after symptoms have stopped and faecal-oral contact during sex should be avoided for 4 to 6 weeks. Awareness activities targeted at MSM, especially those identified to be at higher risk, e.g. MSM on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), should also be considered to increase knowledge about the ongoing threat of shigellosis.\r\n\r\n\"People with gastrointestinal symptoms should not handle and prepare food for catering or in private households until fully recovered or stool culture is negative for Shigella. In healthcare settings, in addition to standard precautions, contact precautions, including placement in a single room with a dedicated toilet, adequate access to hand hygiene and regular environmental cleaning, should be considered for suspected or confirmed extensively drug-resistant _S. sonnei_ cases.\r\n\r\n\"There are very limited options for treatment of extensively-drug resistant _S. sonnei_. Clinicians should be aware of increasing trends of antimicrobial resistance in _Shigella_ spp. and ensure susceptibility testing on all clinical isolates, especially from high-risk groups, from patients returning from international destinations, and from MSM, who are at risk of a resistant infection. When antimicrobial treatment is indicated, it should be based on the results of susceptibility testing. Non-specialist physicians should be aware that among young adult males, especially among those with no travel history, the route of acquisition can be sexual.\r\n\r\n\"Timely antimicrobial resistance profiles with sufficient epidemiological information will enable early detection and investigation of treatment failures and will inform national and international treatment guidelines. Reporting of outbreaks with extensively-drug resistant _S. sonnei_ and related treatment failures should be strengthened at the national and European level to enable rapid intervention and to prevent the spread of antimicrobial-resistant _S. sonnei_. Timely sharing of data on treatment failure among EU/EEA countries will facilitate a more effective response. The use of EpiPulse is encouraged to implement rapid information sharing at the European level. Any new information linked to this event can be reported in EpiPulse.\r\n\r\n\"ECDC encourages countries to perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) on _S. sonnei_ isolates linked to human infections, especially extensively drug-resistant ones. ECDC can provide WGS support for isolates possibly linked to multi-country events.\"\r\n\r\nOf the 4 _Shigella_ species (_Shigella sonnei_, _Shigella flexneri_, _Shigella boydii_, and _Shigella dysenteriae_), _S. sonnei_ is the commonest species in the United States. Humans are the only reservoir for _Shigella_, which are easily transmitted person-to-person because _Shigella_ are relatively resistant to gastric acidity, and only a few (10 to 100) organisms if swallowed, will survive passage through the stomach and be sufficient to establish infection in the lower intestinal tract. \r\n\r\nThe organisms are spread via hands, mouth, food, or water that have come into contact with the stool of a person infected with _Shigella_. Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease. Although shigellosis is usually self-limited in 5-7 days without antibiotic treatment, antibiotics are commonly used to decrease fecal excretion of the organism that may otherwise last up to several weeks and for severe cases that have prolonged dysentery or sepsis. However, resistance to antimicrobials has restricted treatment options.\r\n\r\nIn 2015 ProMED posted a report of an outbreak of multidrug-resistant (MDR) _Shigella sonnei_ in the USA, affecting more than 300 people that appeared to have been repeatedly imported by international travel in men who have sex with men (MSM) (ProMED post Shigellosis - USA (03): travel, MSM, antimicrobial resistance 20151021.3732921). In 2016 ProMED posted a report of a single clone, based on WGS, widespread in South Asia, that was likely driving an intercontinental surge of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ (ProMED post Shigellosis, antimicrobial-resistant - South Asia: spread 20160904.4464085). Then, in 2019, ProMED reported an outbreak between March and November 2018 in the UK of 17 cases of shigellosis caused by an MDR _Shigella_ clone, based on whole genome sequencing (WGS), that clustered among MSM. A total of 9 further cases were identified in the USA (Shigellosis - UK: multiresistant, MSM 20190128.6279377 and <https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/769163/SHGLL-SONN_2018275.pdf>). \r\n\r\nResistance markers in this clone included blaCTX-M-27, which encodes an extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL), a single gyrA mutation associated with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and the macrolide resistance markers erm(B) and mph(A). Consequently, treatment of infections caused by this MDR strain with fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone is unlikely to be effective. TMP/SMX had been one of the drugs of choice for treatment of shigellosis, but emerging resistance to this antimicrobial drug limited its empiric use (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462054/>). - Mod.ML\n\nProMED map:\nEurope: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701701,6010>]\n\n[See Also:\nProMED-AMR\r\nShigellosis - UK: Shigella sonnei, multidrug resistant clone, MSM 20220131.8701181\r\nProMED\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nShigellosis - UK: multiresistant, MSM 20190128.6279377\r\n2016\r\n----\r\nShigellosis, antimicrobial resistant - South Asia: spread 20160904.4464085\r\n2015\r\n----\r\nShigellosis - USA (03): travel, MSM, antimicrobial resistance 20151021.3732921]\n.................................................sb/ml/may/ml"

The virus is spread by mosquito bites.\r\n\r\n\"It is really important to protect yourself from mosquito bites as mosquitoes can spread viruses including Japanese encephalitis,\" said Dr Kerry Chant, Chief Health Officer.\r\n\r\nLess than 1% of people infected with JE experience symptoms, which typically include fever, joint pain, and rash. Occasionally, JE can cause severe neurological illness with headache, convulsions and reduced consciousness.\r\n\r\n\"There is no specific treatment for JE or other mosquito-borne viruses. The best way to avoid infection is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes\", Dr Chant said.\r\n\r\nSimple actions to avoid mosquito bites include:\r\n- Cover up as much as possible with light-coloured, loose-fitting clothing and covered footwear when outside.\r\n- Use an effective insect repellent on exposed skin and reapply within a few hours. The best mosquito repellents contain Diethyl Toluamide (DEET), picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus. \r\n- Use insecticide sprays, vapour dispensing units (indoors) and mosquito coils (outdoors) to clear rooms or repel mosquitoes from an area.\r\n- Cover all windows, doors, vents and other entrances with insect screens.\r\n- Remove any water-holding containers outside the house where mosquitoes could breed.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by: \r\nAndrea Forde\r\n<andrea.m.forde@gmail.com>,\r\nIrene Lai\r\n<irene.lai@internationalsos.com>\r\nand \r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Andrea Forde for submitting this report.\r\n\r\nThe only previously reported case of Japanese encephalitis on the Australian mainland was a Cape York fisherman who became ill in 1998, while the 1st known outbreak in Australia killed 2 people on the outer island of Torres Strait, Queensland in 1995.

There have been cases of Lassa fever in Togo as recently as 2017 and 2019. In the 2017 report, health authorities in Togo implemented the following measures to respond to these Lassa fever cases, including:\r\n\r\n- deployment of rapid response teams to the affected areas for epidemiological investigation;\r\n- identification of contacts and follow-up;\r\n- strengthening of infection prevention and control measures in health facilities and briefing of health workers;\r\n- strengthening of cross-border collaboration and information exchanges between Togo, Burkina, Mali, and Benin.\r\n\r\nIntensification of investigations is underway currently and one hopes that all of these same measures are being implemented now. \r\n\r\nThe case report above mentions contact with rodent reservoirs of the virus or their excrement as a source of infection. Lassa fever virus is transmitted to humans from contact with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp), the reservoir host. Public education is an important measure to prevent infections in the home.\r\n\r\nImages of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus can be seen as follows:\r\n_Mastomys natalensis_: <https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis>\r\n_M. erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: <http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/>. - Mod.TY\n\nProMED map:\nSavanes, Togo: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701715,37481>]\n\n[See Also:\n2019\r\n----\r\nLassa fever - West Africa (02): Togo (KA) 20190108.6248252\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nLassa fever - West Africa (10): Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso 20170312.4896305\r\nLassa fever - West Africa (28): Germany (NW) local transmission, Togo, WHO 20160428.4190457\r\nLassa fever - West Africa (20): Germany (NW) local transmission, Togo, WHO 20160324.4115285\r\nLassa fever - West Africa (15): Togo (SA) 20160317.4101976\r\nLassa fever - West Africa (13): Togo, USA (GA) ex Togo susp, Nigeria 20160314.4090655]\n.................................................sb/mpp/ty/ao/mpp"

Currently, she is in stable condition.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hernandez, during 2021, all the hantavirus cases that were registered in Los Santos were in Tonosi.\r\n\r\nThis past 11 Feb [2022], the Ministry of Health (MINSA) reported the 1st death in Herrera province [from a hantavirus infection]. This was also a 58-year-old woman from the El Pajaro neighborhood, El Jazmin community in Pese district.\r\n\r\nMNSA stated that they have intensified surveillance in nearby communities.\r\n\r\nHantavirus contagion and symptoms\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nHantavirus [produces] a serious, acute disease that is caused by [a] hantavirus. The human hantavirus infection usually occurs in rural areas such as fields and farms where rodents that harbor the virus are found, but also it is possible to have transmission in urban areas.\r\n\r\n[People] acquire the virus by inhalation of excremental [particles], urine, and saliva from infected rodents.\r\n\r\nInfected people can experience headache, nausea, dizziness, chills and fever, and muscle pain, according to data provided on the website of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).\r\n\r\nMINSA issued a call to maintain the cleanliness of one's house and to eliminate the elements that could attract nearby rodents, thus avoiding infections and deaths caused by this disease.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Linda Batista]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this report.\r\n\r\nHantavirus infections in Panama's central provinces, including Herrera and Los Santos, are common, and cases occur there every year.\r\n\r\nAlthough the above and the previous report do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these 2 cases, an earlier WHO report indicates that Choclo is the hantavirus identified in previous cases, based on genomic sequence analysis (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above, or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done, confirms the ProMED conclusion that Choclo virus was involved.\r\n\r\nEarlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.\r\n\r\nThe rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at <http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg>. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and the adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection.\r\n\r\nThe report above does not provide a complete listing of the household measures that should be taken to prevent human exposure. A previous report stated that preventive measures recommended include the following:\r\n\r\n- store grain in sacks and closed plastic containers, place them on pallets, and keep them separated from the walls;\r\n- place firewood, lumber, or any other useful materials distant from the house, in an arid, dry area and on pallets;\r\n- drain residual water from patios and keep them clean;\r\n- keep the kitchen area clean and utensils in covered containers, to avoid their contact with rodents;\r\n- open doors and windows for 60 minutes before cleaning areas that have been closed for a long time;\r\n- spray the floor with water [a 10% bleach solution is better] to avoid raising dust that may contain virus-contaminated excrement from infected rodents. - Mod.TY\r\n\r\nProMED map of Los Santos, Panama: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701718,41725>]\n\n[See Also:\nHantavirus - Americas (05): Panama (HE) 20220210.8701356\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nHantavirus - Americas (06): Panama 20210622.8465364\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nHantavirus - Americas (05): Panama 20200514.7333741\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nHantavirus - Americas (29): Panama (LS) 20190724.6586119\r\nHantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nHantavirus - Americas (62): Bolivia (TR), Panama (HE) 20181027.6114995\r\nHantavirus - Americas (56): Panama (LS) 20181018.6098429\r\nHantavirus - Americas (50): Panama (LS) 20180817.5972602\r\nHantavirus - Americas (40): Panama (LS) 20180610.5848603\r\nHantavirus - Americas (31): Panama (LS) 20180426.5770153\r\nHantavirus - Americas (29): Panama (LS) 20180418.5755541\r\nHantavirus - Americas (28): Panama (LS) 20180401.5722787\r\nHantavirus - Americas (22): Panama (LS) 20180315.5689599\r\nHantavirus - Americas (20): Panama (LS) 20180312.5680250\r\nHantavirus - Americas (17): Panama (LS) 20180302.5662121\r\nHantavirus - Americas (14): USA (AZ), Panama (LS) 20180301.5657531\r\nHantavirus - Americas (06): Panama (LS) 20180130.559469]\n.................................................mpp/ty/tw/mpp"

The highest number of infections (295) was recorded in Thi-Qar province; all cases were confirmed either by dipstick rk39 test or by bone marrow examination.\r\n\r\nThe areas of marshlands are regarded as suitable environmental for the growth and reproduction of vectors; the rate distribution of sand flies was 100% in all provinces (p>0.05), while in reservoir hosts there are significant differences (p<0.05) among south provinces.\r\n\r\nVL has dynamic epidemiology factors that can change under the influence of climate, ecology, behavior of humans, vectors, and reservoirs.

Bluetongue is usually fatal in bighorn sheep and can also affect other ruminants (large, hoofed mammals) says Dr Caelet Thacker, BC's provincial wildlife veterinarian.\r\n\r\nBighorn sheep are a blue-listed species in BC which means they are a species that is not immediately threatened but they are of concern due to their sensitivity to human activity and natural events. This herd was one of the few in the province that was doing extremely well prior to the event, says Bear Brandrow, a local hunting guide in Grand Forks.\r\n\r\nBluetongue is carried by an insect, a biting midge. In bighorn sheep, common symptoms of bluetongue virus are swollen lips and a high fever. In a 10-day span, the population of bighorn sheep in Grand Forks was reduced drastically and unfortunately, there was nothing that could be done for the sheep that were already infected. Lab tests confirmed that the sheep in Grand Forks died from this disease in summer 2021.\r\n\r\nThe morbidity for bighorn sheep can be up to 100 per cent. The results of infection can be devastating to any herd but even more so to one as small and isolated as the one in Grand Forks.\r\n\r\nAlthough they carry and transmit diseases that are fatal among certain animal populations, midges play an important role in our fragile ecosystem. Midges are an important food source for aquatic insects, fish, amphibians, birds, and bats. The larvae clean the aquatic environment by consuming decomposed organic matter and recycling it. These tiny insects thrive in virtually every freshwater habitat. There are more than 4000 species of midges globally and more than 600 of these occur in North America. Midges are found on every continent but Antarctica. In Canada alone, there are over one thousand named species of midges. They are found across the country and live in a variety of habitats.\r\n\r\nThey are also great indicators of pollution. The presence of midges in tidal pools indicates healthy oxygen levels in the water. The absence of midges can indicate pollution or poor water quality. In sewage treatment plants, water authorities use midge counts to help monitor contamination levels. Some midges are predators that feed on bacteria, algae, water fleas, and other larvae, organisms that can contaminate water supplies. Additionally, midges are natural pollinators, which is beneficial to agriculture.\r\n\r\nWhile midges have an impact on wildlife, they do not transmit diseases to humans. Hopefully, there can be a solution to protecting sheep and deer from the midge-borne disease, bluetongue, without destroying an abundant food source for aquatic animals and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED-AMR\n\n[Bighorn sheep populations are often affected by outbreaks of pneumonia. Bluetongue has been reported less frequently.

The results were positive for the ASF virus. The AFCD will continue to monitor wild pig deaths and maintain surveillance in the wild pig population.\r\n\r\nCurrently, no pig farms are affected by this case. There are no pig farms on Hong Kong Island. The AFCD has notified all local pig farmers about the case with a reminder to them to enhance farm biosecurity to prevent intrusion of wild pigs and the introduction of the ASF virus into their farms. Local pig farmers are also reminded to notify the AFCD if their pigs show any health issues. The AFCD has been closely monitoring the health conditions of pigs on all local pig farms and samples will be collected for testing if necessary.\r\n\r\nAn AFCD spokesman said, \"ASF is a highly contagious disease affecting domestic and wild pigs. However, it is not a zoonotic disease and does not infect humans [but lapses in biosecurity measures favor the spread of the disease], and hence does not cause any food safety risk. Well-cooked pork is safe for consumption.\"\r\n\r\nThe spokesman stressed that for personal safety and prevention of foods contaminated with the ASF virus being introduced to wild pigs, members of the public should keep away from wild pigs. They should not feed any wildlife, including wild pigs, and put garbage in lidded bins. That wild pigs found should be reported via 1823.\r\n\r\nWith a view to strengthening the surveillance of ASF on local wild pigs, the AFCD has been working with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) on a surveillance programme for ASF since late 2019. This has involved testing for the ASF virus in wild pig carcasses reported by the FEHD. The programme includes the New Territories and Kowloon. Other areas found with a large number of wild pig deaths are also included. To enable early detection, samples collected from humanely dispatched wild pigs are also tested for ASF.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating hemorrhagic fever of pigs with extremely high mortality rates. In affected countries, it causes huge economic losses. ASF is believed to have evolved in a sylvatic cycle that occurs in eastern and southern Africa between common warthogs (_Phacochoerus africanus_) and argasid ticks of the _Ornithodoros moubata_ complex that share their burrows. But the tick is not necessary for the ASF virus transmission. If it were, the disease would not have spread to so many continents.\r\n\r\nPigs in the acute stage of infection develop high viremia and shed large amounts of virus in various secretions and excretions. The virus can tolerate a wide range of temperatures and pH. Pigs can become infected through direct contact with infected pigs or materials contaminated by infected pigs and eating uncooked meat products derived from infected pigs, as well as when infected _Ornithodoros_ ticks feed on them.\r\n\r\nThe importance of wildlife reservoirs for disease maintenance has been demonstrated.

The predominant subtype noticed in the current epidemic season is subtype H5N1.\u202fDuring the period of interest, more than 5 million poultry birds have died from the disease or have been killed and disposed of due to outbreaks. Notifications in wild birds in multiple countries and regions indicate a possible introduction and spread of the virus through current wild bird migration. The increased number of notifications reflects the annual seasonal trend of HPAI cases. Based on this known pattern, February is known to be the peak of the epidemic season. In this context, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) urges countries to intensify surveillance efforts, implement strict biosecurity measures at farm level to prevent the introduction of the disease, continue timely reporting of avian influenza outbreaks in both poultry and non-poultry species, and maintain the high quality of the information provided to support early detection and rapid response to potential threats to both animal and public health.\"\r\n(Source: OIE High pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) -- situation report no. 26, 2022 (last update 24 Feb 2022) <https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2022/03/hpai-situation-report-20220224.pdf>.)\r\n- Mod.CRD]\n\n[See Also:\nAvian influenza (52): Asia (Philippines, India) poultry, HPAI H5N1, OIE 20220224.8701632\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (73): Nepal (KT, BM) poultry, HPAI H5N8, spread 20210527.8387139\r\nAvian influenza (37): Asia (Japan) wild bird, HPAI H5N1, OIE 20220208.8701340\r\nAvian influenza (35): Japan (CH), Nepal (KT), poultry, HPAI H5N8 20210213.8189507\r\nAvian influenza (23): India, Nepal, Germany, poultry, wild bird, HPAI H5N1, H5N8, OIE 20210202.8156270]\n.................................................crd/mj/mpp"

COLI, ENTEROINVASIVE - DENMARK: IMPORTED SPRING ONIONS, FATAL\n****************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Wed 2 Mar 2022\r\nSource: Food Safety News [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2022/03/three-people-died-in-danish-e-coli-outbreak-dozens-more-infected/>\r\n\r\n\r\nDanish authorities have revealed that 3 people died in an _E. coli_ outbreak this past year [2021]. Imported spring onions were investigated as the source. An update by the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) revealed that from 23 Nov 2021 to 31 Dec 2021, 85 people were infected with EIEC.\r\n\r\nEnteroinvasive _E. coli_ (EIEC) is usually associated with travel diarrhea, but the patients had not been abroad. It was previously reported that 68 people were ill in the outbreak linked to spring onions from Egypt via a Dutch supplier that were used in ready-to-eat salads.\r\n\r\nSick people lived all over the country, except for Nordjylland. They included 56 women and 29 men aged less than 1 to 91 years old. The median age was 52. Three deaths were linked to the outbreak, and 25 people were hospitalized. Sjaelland had the most patients with 29, Hovedstaden had 23, Midtjylland had 21, and 12 were from Syddanmark.\r\n\r\nThe Statens Serum Institut, Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fodevarestyrelsen) and DTU Food Institute found the source of infection was spring onions in salads sold in 3 different retail chains in November 2021. Interviews of patients found several of them had eaten the salads, and purchasing data showed they were bought from 15-30 Nov 2021.\r\n\r\nEnteroinvasive _E. coli_ was isolated from 36 patients, and the remaining 47 were PCR positive for a gene specific to _Shigella_ species and EIEC. Further analysis identified 2 _E. coli_ serotypes in the outbreak: O136:H7 and O96:H19 with confirmation by whole-genome sequencing.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Joe Whitworth]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[EIEC is a human enteric pathogen that causes a shigellosis-like dysentery and is transmitted through contaminated food or water and person-to-person contact (1). Infections occur most commonly in developing countries (1,2). The 1971 outbreak in the United States was associated with imported cheese (3). More recently, contaminated vegetables were implicated in outbreaks in Italy in 2012 and the United Kingdom in 2014 (4,5). A 2018 outbreak investigation did not reveal the specific vehicle through which EIEC was transmitted.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------\r\n1. Gomes T A T, Elias W P, Scaletsky I C, et al.

They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.\r\n\r\nTravellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nWhile local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.\r\n\r\nThe public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:\r\n\r\n- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;\r\n- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;\r\n- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;\r\n- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and\r\n- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page and the YouTube Channel [see source URL for weblinks to these pages].\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for sharing this update on human cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 in China.\r\n\r\nThe above report mentions 4 new cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 in mainland China including one death, bumping the total cases in 2022 to 9. From 2014 to date, 71 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities.\r\n\r\nAvian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans may range from flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) to severe respiratory illness (e.g., chest infection). Eye infection (conjunctivitis) and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) have also been reported. The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death.\r\n\r\nPeople mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.\r\n\r\nWhenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases appears to be increasing. - Mod.UBA\n\nProMED map:\nChina: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701722,155>]\n\n[See Also:\nAvian influenza, human (07): Asia (China) H5N6 20220217.8701493\r\nAvian influenza, human (06): Asia (China) H9N2, H5N6 20220131.8701114\r\nAvian influenza, human (05): Asia (China) H9N2 20220123.8700993\r\nAvian influenza, human (04): Asia (China) H5N6 20220117.8700903\r\nAvian influenza, human (03): China (GD) H5N6 20220109.8700750\r\nAvian influenza, human (02): Asia (China) H9N2 20220109.8700749\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza, human (26): China (Hong Kong) H5N6 20211219.8700294\r\nAvian influenza, human (25): China (SC, GD) H5N6 20211211.8700163\r\nAvian influenza, human (24): China (GZ) H9N2 20211124.8699804\r\nAvian influenza, human (23): China (HN) H5N6 20211028.8699277\r\nAvian influenza, human (22): China (GX) H5N6 20211003.8698793\r\nAvian influenza, human (21): China (GD) H5N6 20210927.8698701\r\nAvian influenza, human (19): China (HN), H5N6 20210919.8685382\r\nAvian influenza, human (18): China (GX) H5N6 20210911.8657500\r\nAvian influenza, human (17): China (HN) H9N2 20210906.8647141\r\nAvian influenza, human (16): China (GD) H5N6 20210825.8611614\r\nAvian influenza, human (14): China (SC) H5N6 20210724.8542205\r\nAvian influenza, human (12): China (SC) H5N6 20210716.8519755\r\nAvian influenza, human (11): China (SC) H5N6 20210612.8437106\r\nAvian influenza, human (08): China (GD) H9N2 20210508.8345139\r\nAvian influenza, human (07): China (FJ, HU) H9N2 20210425.8327505\r\nAvian influenza, human (06): Laos, H5N6, 1st case 20210412.8301144\r\nAvian influenza, human (05): Nigeria, A/H5 20210407.8294492\r\nAvian influenza, human (04): China (GX) H5N6, fatal 20210325.8265645\r\nAvian influenza, human (03): Russia, H5N8, update 20210228.8217634\r\nAvian influenza, human (02): Russia, H5N8, 1st case 20210221.8204014\r\nAvian influenza, human (01): China (GD) H9N2, alert 20210120.8111218\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza, human (05): China (GD) H9N2, new case 20201004.7835005\r\nAvian influenza, human (04): China (FJ, SD) H9N2, new cases 20200530.7392699\r\nAvian influenza, human (03): China (GD) H9N2, WHO 20200407.7195272\r\nAvian influenza, human (02): Senegal, India, H9N2, WHO, RFI 20200309.7059887\r\nAvian influenza, human: China (Hong Kong) H9N2 20200208.6967624\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza, human (11): China (FJ, AH) H9N2 20191211.6834041\r\nAvian influenza, human (08): Oman (BS) H9N2, RFI 20190508.6460574\r\nAvian influenza, human (03): China (HN) H9N2, 2018 20190205.6295949\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza, human (24): China (GD, GX) H9N2 20181226.6223398\r\nAvian influenza, human (13): China (GD) H9N2 20180801.5940642\r\nAvian influenza (118): India (BR) backyard, HPAI H5N1, OIE 20181228.6226636\r\nAvian influenza (77): Nepal (TH) poultry, HPAI H5N1, OIE 20180530.5828169\r\nAvian influenza (75): Nepal (Narayani) poultry, HPAI H5N1, OIE 20180519.5805891\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza, human (65): China (GD) H9N2, human-animal interface, WHO 20170812.5242688\r\n2016\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza, human (60): China (JX) H9N2 20160912.4481431\r\nAvian influenza, human (59): China (YN) H9N2 20160901.4451359\r\nAvian influenza, human (51): China (GD) H9N2 20160621.4299567\r\nAvian influenza, human (31): China H7N9, avian flu update, China (FJ) H7N9, China (SC) H9N2 20160318.4101269\r\nAvian influenza, human (14): Egypt A(H5N1,H9N2) CDC/EID 20160122.3956280\r\n2015\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza, human (130): China (AH, HN) H9N2 20151217.3867941\r\nAvian influenza, human (120): Bangladesh, H9N2 20150923.3666519\r\nAvian influenza, human (108): Egypt, H9N2, influenza B 20150522.3378923\r\nAvian influenza, human (44): Egypt (AS) H9N2, 1st case 20150215.3168314\r\n2014\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza, human (78): China, H7N9, new cases, H9N2 control 20140227.2304226\r\nAvian influenza, human (02): China (HK) H9N2 ex (HN) 20140102.2148327]\n.................................................mpp/uba/rd/mpp"

The NZ Passion fruit Growers Association said the disease had been more prevalent in the last 2 years due to warmer weather. It was first discovered in New Zealand in 2015 but is suspected to always have been in the country since it is common in the crop elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe disease is devastating for some growers, because once it is in the soil, it is difficult to get rid of. New plantings tend to die. There are some passion fruit varieties resistant to the wilt. The Association is looking at different root stocks being trialled by 10 growers and hope to know within the next 6 to 12 months if they are suitable.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Sally Murphy]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Strains and pathovars of _Fusarium oxysporum_ have now been reclassified as members of a species complex (FOSC; see link below for new taxonomy). The pathogens within the species complex vary in host range. Passion fruit wilt (also called 'sudden death') is caused by _F. oxysporum_ f.sp. _passiflorae_. Symptoms include yellowing of vines, wilting of branches, and root and collar rot. Eventually the whole plant dries up and dies.\r\n\r\nFOSC fungi can survive in the soil for decades. Consequently, disease management is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. Integrated approaches have been developed for some crops, which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents. Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the diseases. Constant vigilance is required in areas where one of the fungi is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.\r\n\r\nDifferent members of the FOSC cause wilting diseases with serious losses in other crops, such as banana (Panama disease), guava, vanilla, date palm, and a range of cucurbits. Each is highly specialised, attacking only a single crop species.\r\n\r\nMaps\r\nNew Zealand:\r\n<https://www.fotolip.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/New-Zealand-Map-1.jpg> and\r\n<http://ontheworldmap.com/new-zealand/new-zealand-regions-map.jpg> (regions)\r\n\r\nPictures\r\nPassion fruit fusarium wilt:\r\n<https://media.padil.gov.au/species/136585/2376-large.jpg>,\r\n<https://media.padil.gov.au/species/136585/5246-large.jpg>,\r\n<https://media.padil.gov.au/species/136585/5248-large.jpg>,\r\n<https://media.padil.gov.au/species/136585/2372-large.jpg> and\r\n<https://www.plantwise.org/knowledgebank/factsheetadmin/uploads/factsheets/58F725D6-36C2-4EBE-82D1-BF9A870A3302.JPG>\r\n\r\nLinks\r\nInformation on passion fruit fusarium wilt:\r\n<https://www.plantwise.org/KnowledgeBank/factsheetforfarmers/20137804234>,\r\n<https://doi.org/10.1111/jph.12871>,\r\n<https://www.scielo.br/j/tpp/a/w8yFsjzqgG8tYM38TZrx4Mf/>,\r\n<https://www.padil.gov.au/pests-and-diseases/pest/main/136585>, via\r\n<https://vikaspedia.in/agriculture/crop-production/integrated-pest-managment/ipm-for-fruit-crops/ipm-strategies-for-passion-fruit/passion-fruit-diseases>,\r\n<https://passionfruit.co.ke/index.php/category/fusarium-wilt/> and\r\n<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306034959_Chapter_24_Diseases_of_Passion_Fruit_Passiflora_edulis_and_their_Management_pp_453-470>\r\nFusarium wilts, multiple crops:\r\n<https://infonet-biovision.org/PlantHealth/Pests/Fusarium-wilt>\r\nReclassification of Fo species and strains:\r\n<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simyco.2018.10.004>\r\nTaxonomy of all reclassified _Fusarium_ species via:\r\n<http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/Names.asp>\r\n- Mod.DHA]\n\n[See Also:\nPanama disease, banana - Viet Nam: pathogen diversity 20220216.8701506\r\nPanama disease & bunchy top, banana - Pakistan: (SD) 20220214.8701445\r\nPanama disease TR4, banana - Colombia: (MA) 20220109.8700686\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nFusarium wilt, lettuce - Norway: 1st rep 20210513.8360921\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nFusarium wilts, cucurbits - Pakistan: (SD) 20190612.6515954\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nFusarium wilt, lettuce - Ireland: 1st rep, UK spread 20180910.6018539\r\nFusarium wilt, lettuce - UK: (England) 20180618.5861084\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nFusarium wilt, sweet potato - Philippines: (BG) 20170120.4778743\r\nFungal root rots, sugar beet - UK: (East Anglia) 20170117.4770335\r\nFusarium wilt, lettuce - UK: 1st rep 20171030.5412370\r\n2012\r\n----\r\nWilt, guava - South Africa: northern 20120719.1206910\r\n2011\r\n----\r\nFusarium wilt, watermelon - Australia: (NT), spread 20110930.2948\r\n2010 \r\n----\r\nFusarium root rot, vanilla - Madagascar 20101210.4399\r\nand additional items on fusarium diseases in the archives]\n.................................................sb/dha/tw"

Parents and caregivers of newborns should not feed their baby recalled Similac, Alimentum, or EleCare powdered infant formulas.\r\n\r\nThe FDA (<https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/fda-investigation-cronobacter-and-salmonella-complaints-powdered-infant-formula-february-2022>) also reports one complaint of _Salmonella_ infection in an infant who was fed recalled formula. CDC has not detected any _Salmonella_ illnesses linked to this case. CDC is currently working with state and local partners to determine whether any other _Salmonella_ illnesses are linked to recalled infant formula.\r\n\r\nFast facts\r\n---------\r\nIllnesses: 4\r\nDeaths: 2\r\nStates: 3 (Minnesota, Ohio, Texas)\r\nRecall: yes\r\nInvestigation status: active\r\n\r\nRecalled powdered infant formula\r\n---------------------------------\r\nOn 28 Feb 2022, Abbott Nutrition recalled one lot of Similac PM 60/40 powdered formula (Lot #\u202f27032K80 (can) / Lot # 27032K800 (case) manufactured in Sturgis, Michigan. Review these codes on the bottom of the package to find out if the product you have is included in this recall. Parents and caregivers can also enter their product lot code on the company's website (<https://www.similacrecall.com/us/en/product-lookup.html>) to check if it is part of the recall. The Similac PM 60/40 recall is in addition to other lots of Similac, Alimentum, and EleCare powdered formula that were recalled on 17 Feb 2022.\r\n\r\nThe 28 Feb [2022] recall comes after a report of the death of an infant who tested positive for _Cronobacter sakazakii_ and who consumed Similac PM 60/40 powdered formula from this lot.\r\n\r\nSimilac, Alimentum, or EleCare powdered formula products recalled on 17 Feb [2022] have all 3 of these conditions:\r\n- 1st 2 digits of the code are 22 through 37, AND on the container contains \"K8,\" \"SH,\" or \"Z2,\" AND Use-by date is 1 Apr 2022 (APR 2022) or later.\r\n\r\n-To find out if the product you have is included in this recall, review product lot code on the bottom of the package. See the 17 Feb [2022] recall notice (<https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/abbott-voluntarily-recalls-powder-formulas-manufactured-one-plant>) for more information.\r\n\r\nAdvice for parents and caregivers\r\n--------------------------------------\r\nDo not feed your baby any recalled powdered formula.\r\n\r\nIf you feed your baby with other types of Similac PM 60/40 powdered formula:\r\n- Check for the lot code 27032K800 that is included in the expanded recall. At this time, Similac PM 60/40 with lot code 27032K80 (can) / 27032K800 (case) is the only type and lot of this specialty formula being recalled.\r\n- To find out if the product you have is included in this recall, review product lot code on the bottom of the package and enter it on Abbott Nutrition's website.\r\n\r\nIf you feed your baby with other types of Similac, Alimentum, or EleCare powdered formula:\r\nCheck to see if your powdered formula is recalled using one of these 3 ways:\r\n- Compare the lot code and use-by date on the bottom of the package to the recall information.\r\n- Visit Abbott Nutrition's website (<https://www.similacrecall.com/us/en/product-lookup.html>) and type in the code on the bottom of the package.\r\n- Call 1-800-986-8540 and follow the instructions provided.\r\n\r\nIf you have any recalled powdered formula, immediately stop feeding it to your baby and return it for a refund at the store where you bought it. You can also return it to Abbott Nutrition.\r\n\r\nIf you can't find the code on the powdered formula package, do not use it.\r\n\r\nParents and caregivers should never dilute powdered infant formula (by adding more water than recommended or another solvent to it) and should not make or feed homemade infant formula to infants.\r\n\r\nDo not buy formula online that comes from outside the USA. This formula could be counterfeit; for example, it may have fake labels to misrepresent the quality or identity of a formula, the product may not have the proper nutrients or ingredients to feed your baby, or it might have a fake label with a wrong use-by date.\r\n\r\nIf you get infant formula through the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, do not throw the formula out. Instead, you should take it to the store for a refund and exchange or call the company at 1-800-986-8540 to help you. WIC recipients should be able to obtain a different brand of similar formula. Call your local WIC clinic for more guidance.\r\n\r\nContact your baby's healthcare provider if\r\n- your baby has symptoms of _Cronobacter_ illness (fever and poor feeding, excessive crying, or very low energy);\r\n- your regular formula is not available, and you need recommendations on other ways to feed your baby.\r\n\r\nSymptoms\r\n-----------\r\n-The 1st symptom of _Cronobacter_  infection in infants (0-1 year old) is usually a fever, accompanied by poor feeding, excessive crying, or very low energy. Some infants may also have seizures. Infants with these symptoms should be seen by a medical provider as soon as possible.\r\n-_Cronobacter_ germs can cause a dangerous blood infection (sepsis) or make the linings surrounding the brain and spinal cord swell (meningitis). Infections in infants usually occur in the 1st days or weeks of life. Infants 2 months of age and younger are most likely to develop meningitis if they are infected with _Cronobacter_.\r\n\r\nWhat healthcare providers/laboratories should do\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n- If a _Cronobacter_ infection is diagnosed by a laboratory culture, CDC encourages clinicians and laboratories to inform their local or state health department.\r\n- _Cronobacter_ can be detected in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with meningitis or sepsis caused by these bacteria.\r\n- _Cronobacter_ bacteria grow on routine culture media, and microbiological laboratories can detect _Cronobacter_ from blood or CSF samples.\r\n- CDC does not recommend testing infants for _Cronobacter_ infection unless they have symptoms of meningitis or sepsis, even if they consumed recalled formula.\r\n- CDC does not recommend testing stool for _Cronobacter_. _Cronobacter_ infection does not typically cause diarrhea in infants.\r\n- CDC does not recommend testing formula for _Cronobacter_ contamination unless an infant has a diagnosed _Cronobacter_ infection.\r\n- Please contact your local or state health department if your child has been diagnosed with _Cronobacter_ infection and consumed recalled formula.\r\n\r\nDescription of cases\r\n---------------------\r\nOn 10 Feb 2022, CDC was notified of FDA's investigation of consumer complaints of infant illness related to products from Abbott Nutrition in Sturgis, Michigan. These complaints include 3 reports of _Cronobacter sakazakii_ infections and one report of _Salmonella_ Newport infection in infants. CDC and FDA are conducting additional laboratory testing and investigation to better understand these cases as well as any additional cases.\r\n\r\nThe most recent investigation details are summarized below:\r\n\r\nFrom 16 Sep 2021 to 5 Jan 2022, CDC received reports of 3 _Cronobacter_ cases in infants that were later found to be linked to FDA's ongoing investigation. On 16 Feb 2022, CDC asked clinicians and state and local health departments to provide information on other cases of _Cronobacter_ infection associated with infant formula from November 2020 through the present. Since then, CDC has identified one additional reported case of _Cronobacter_ infection in an infant who consumed formula produced at this facility.\r\n\r\nAs of 28 Feb 2022:\r\n\r\n- 4 infants in Minnesota (1), Ohio (2), and Texas (1) consumed formula produced at the Sturgis, Michigan, facility before they got sick. These infants consumed formula that included Similac Sensitive, Similac Pro-total Comfort, Similac Advance, and Similac PM 60/40.\r\n- _Cronobacter_ infections may have contributed to the death of 2 infants in Ohio.\r\n\r\nCDC has received reports of more possible cases of _Cronobacter_ illnesses in infants and is investigating to determine if these cases are linked to formula products produced at the Abbott Nutrition facility in Sturgis, Michigan. CDC is performing whole-genome sequencing on _Cronobacter_ bacteria isolated from available patient samples to compare them with the environmental samples taken at the facility to determine if there is any relation.\r\n\r\nFDA reports one complaint of a _Salmonella_ infection in an infant who was fed recalled formula. CDC's routine outbreak surveillance has not detected an outbreak of _Salmonella_ illnesses linked to this case reported to FDA or any other cases of _Salmonella_ linked to recalled formula.\r\n\r\nAbout _Cronobacter_\r\n-----------------------\r\n_Cronobacter sakazakii_ is a bacterium found naturally in the environment and can live in very dry places. The organism can live in dry foods, such as powdered infant formula, powdered milk, herbal teas, and starches. _Cronobacter_ infection is not reportable in most states, meaning doctors are not required to report cases to their health department. _Cronobacter_ illnesses are rare, but when infections happen, they can be deadly for infants. CDC typically receives reports of 2-4 infections in infants per year, but the total number of cases that occur in the United States each year is not known.\r\n\r\nHow _Cronobacter_ bacteria can spread\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nAt a production factory, _Cronobacter_ bacteria could get into formula powder if contaminated raw materials are used to make the formula or if the formula powder touches a contaminated surface in the manufacturing environment. Powdered infant formula could also become contaminated at home or elsewhere after the container is opened. For example, _Cronobacter_ bacteria could get into the formula if formula lids or scoops are placed on contaminated surfaces and later touch the formula or if the formula is mixed with contaminated water or in a contaminated bottle. See more information on how to safely prepare and store powdered infant formula.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Several clusters of cases of infection with _C. sakazakii_ linked to contaminated powdered infant formula have been reported in the past. This cluster may have dual contamination with this organism and _Salmonella_ Newport.\r\n\r\n_Cronobacter sakazakii_ is a facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacillus that belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family. The organism has been implicated in neonatal intensive care unit outbreaks of meningitis, septicemia, and necrotizing enterocolitis, particularly in preterm infants, although infections due to _C. sakazakii_ can occur in older infants, children, and adults.\r\n\r\nThe association of neonatal infection due to _C. sakazakii_ with the use of powdered infant formula is not new. ProMED has previously reported on infection associated with powdered infant formula contaminated by _C. sakazakii_ (formerly called _Enterobacter sakazakii_) as seen in the \"See Also\" section below.\r\n\r\nThe organism has been associated with a number of different kinds of powdered formulas from many different countries, including the USA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _Enterobacter sakazakii_ infections associated with the use of powdered infant formula - Tennessee, 2001. MMWR. 2002; 51(14): 297-300).\r\n\r\nGenotyping has shown that patient and formula isolates shared the same typing pattern (Clark N C, Hill B C, O'Hara C M, et al. Epidemiologic typing of _Enterobacter sakazakii_ in 2 neonatal nosocomial outbreaks. Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 1990; 13(6): 467-72; doi: 10.1016/0732-8893(90)90078-a).\r\n\r\n_Cronobacter_ are frequently isolated from the environment, plant material (wheat, rice, herbs, and spices) and various food products. Ingredients, such as starches from wheat and rice, can be a source of _Cronobacter_ that have been found to contaminate powdered infant formula.\r\n\r\nBecause powdered infant formulas are not necessarily sterile and may contain pathogenic bacteria, recommendations have been made concerning preparation and handling of these products (Agostoni C, Axelsson I, Goulet O, et al. Preparation and handling of powdered infant formula: a commentary by the ESPGHAN committee on nutrition. J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2004; 39(4): 320-22; doi: 10.1097/00005176-200410000-00002). - Mod.LL\r\n\r\nProMED map of United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701756,106>]\n\n[See Also:\nCronobacteriosis, salmonellosis - USA (02): (WV) pwdr form, alert, recall, fatal 20220227.8701696\r\nCronobacteriosis, salmonellosis - USA: powdered formula, alert, recall, fatal 20220218.8701527\r\n2012\r\n----\r\nCronobacter sakazakii, infant formula, fatal - USA: corr 20120101.0003\r\n2011\r\n----\r\nCronobacter sakazakii, infant formula, fatal - USA: (MO, IL) recall 20111224.3670\r\n2005\r\n----\r\nEnterobacter sakazakii, infant formula - Ireland (02): background 20050127.0299\r\nEnterobacter sakazakii, infant formula - Ireland: recall 20050126.0277]\n.................................................sb/ll/tw/mpp"

This is the 3rd consecutive year of infection. Due to good rainfall, mangos had flowered well. But they are now slowly being destroyed by a fungal disease, according to a local association of mango growers. They expect less than 10% of production in 2022 due to the disease.\r\n\r\nThe famers want guidance and advice from the Horticulture Department on how to prevent infection. Currently, giving advice is left to private fertiliser dealers. The growers underline the need for guidance from the department and also demand compensation for crop loss.\r\n\r\n[Byline: P V Srividya]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Mango (_Mangifera indica_) is one of the most important fruits worldwide. A number of fungal and some bacterial diseases affecting the crop have been reported in the region, including anthracnose, mildews, leaf and stem blights, diebacks, and root rots. Many of these pathogens are favoured by humidity. Furthermore, wounds due to insects, weather, or other mechanical damage may provide easy entrance points for infection.\r\n\r\nAnthracnose, which is considered the most important disease of mango, is present in India and the region (e.g., ProMED post 20210708.8502890). It is caused by fungi in the genus _Colletotrichum_ and is favoured by humid conditions during early flowering. Besides leaf, fruit, and twig symptoms (see previous ProMED posts in the archives and links below), infection may lead to blight and necrosis of flowers, which can be completely destroyed. While this may be the disease referred to above, reliable diagnosis of any pathogen(s) involved in the reported problems is needed to be able to design appropriate management strategies for local conditions.\r\n\r\nMaps\r\nIndia (with states):\r\n<https://www.worldometers.info/img/maps/india_physical_map.gif>\r\nTamil Nadu districts:\r\n<https://i.pinimg.com/736x/26/75/6d/26756d256f9b2e294baa3fc6fa09bb1e.jpg>\r\n\r\nPictures\r\nPhoto gallery of some mango disease symptoms:\r\n<http://www.ipmimages.org/browse/AreaSubs.cfm?area=140>\r\nAnthracnose symptoms on mango flowers:\r\n<https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Mango_anthracnose_1a.jpg> and\r\n<http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vQXiCoc7qYM/VT2mQUmAhjI/AAAAAAAABG4/T6F3YijIOSg/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/mango_anthracnose_inflorescence_1.jpg>\r\nMango anthracnose photo gallery via:\r\n<http://www.growables.org/information/TropicalFruit/mangocommondiseases.htm>\r\n\r\nLinks\r\nInformation on mango diseases (with pictures):\r\n<https://vikaspedia.in/agriculture/crop-production/integrated-pest-managment/ipm-for-fruit-crops/ipm-strategies-for-mango/mango-diseases-and-symptoms>,\r\n<http://www.horticultureworld.net/mango-india2.htm> and via\r\n<https://plantvillage.psu.edu/topics/mango/infos> (with pictures)\r\nMango anthracnose, disease information:\r\n<https://apps.lucidcentral.org/pppw_v10/text/web_full/entities/mango_anthracnose_009.htm>,\r\n<https://dpir.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/233591/604.pdf>,\r\n<http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/pd-48.pdf> and\r\n<http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/125876/mango-anthracnose-pf19.pdf>\r\nList of major diseases and pathogens of mango:\r\n<https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/resources/commonnames/Pages/Mango.aspx>\r\n- Mod.DHA]\n\n[See Also:\n2021\r\n----\r\nAnthracnose, mango - India: (KA) 20210708.8502890\r\nSudden decline, mango - Pakistan: (SD) 20210412.8303552y\r\nUndiagnosed diseases, mango - India: (GJ) 20210217.8197747\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nUndiagnosed fungus, mango - Bangladesh: (RP) 20170509.5022580. \r\n2015\r\n----\r\nUndiagnosed disease, mango - Bangladesh: (RS) 20150520.3373444\r\n2012\r\n----\r\nUndiagnosed disease, mango - Bangladesh: (RP) 20120601.1152657\r\n2011\r\n----\r\nUndiagnosed diseases, mango - Pakistan: (SD) update 20110329.0978\r\n2010\r\n----\r\nUndiagnosed diseases, mango - Pakistan: (SD) update 20100729.2543\r\nSudden decline, mango - United Arab Emirates 20100214.0524\r\n2009\r\n----\r\nSudden decline, mango - Oman 20091214.4240\r\nMildew, mango - Bangladesh: (RJ) 20090614.2207\r\nUndiagnosed disease, mango - Pakistan: (SD) RFI 20090511.1762\r\nGummosis, mango - Bangladesh: (RJ) 20090504.1669\r\nand additional items on mango diseases in the archive]\n.................................................sb/dha/tw/mpp"

Among the 3 close contacts, 2 tested positive,\" the minister told a press briefing.\r\n\r\n\"Cases of typhoid fever have been reported previously in Namibia, especially in Kavango East and Kavango West regions due to the use of river water,\" Shangula said. \"Windhoek district in Khomas recorded only one case of typhoid fever in the past 5 years.\"\r\n\r\nHe said typhoid fever, a serious public health problem throughout the world, is transmitted through food and water contaminated by feces and urine of an infected person. Polluted water is the most common source of transmission. \"The public is urged to remain calm and comply with the control measures put in place to contain and prevent further spread of the infection,\" Shangula said.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever, caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation, often without diarrhea, from that of the more common kinds of salmonellosis.\r\n\r\nEpidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.\r\n\r\nThe classic food-related cluster of _S. enterica_ serotype Typhi in the USA occurred related to a summer house in the (still) wealthy suburb of New York City, Oyster Bay, Long Island, in August 1906. This was the still infamous cluster associated with \"Typhoid Mary,\" or Mary Mallon, an Irish immigrant who was both a food preparer and a typhoid bacillus carrier.\r\n\r\nSome strains of the organism have become quite antimicrobial resistant, particularly ones linked to Pakistan (refer to the See Also section below). - Mod.LL\r\n\r\nProMED map of Windhoek, Khomas, Namibia: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701761,3585>]\n\n[See Also:\nTyphoid fever - South Africa 20220217.8701519\r\nTyphoid fever - Congo DR (01) 20220111.8700783\r\nTyphoid fever - Philippines: (NC) 20220105.8700681\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nTyphoid fever - Zambia: (LS) 20211016.8699091\r\nTyphoid fever - Mexico: (TM,SI) 20210928.8698759\r\nTyphoid fever - Congo DR (02) 20210719.8530510\r\nTyphoid fever - Congo DR: (KU) 20210609.8435561\r\nTyphoid fever - Philippines: (Calabarzon) 20210604.8421732\r\nTyphoid fever - Singapore: possible restaurant source 20210215.8192390\r\nTyphoid fever - USA: nonimported XDR Salmonella Typhi infections, 2019-20, alert 20210213.8189506\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nTyphoid fever- Chile: reduced fluoroquine susceptibility 20201022.7880669\r\nTyphoid fever - Pakistan: (KP) 20200721.7591413\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nTyphoid fever - Europe: Ireland, XDR ex Pakistan, ECDC, alert 20191015.6727235\r\nTyphoid fever - Pakistan (04): XDR, travel alert CDC 20191008.6716070\r\nTyphoid fever - Taiwan: ex Pakistan, multidrug resistance 20190926.6696377\r\nTyphoid fever - USA (05): (TX) imported XDR case, possible secondary case 20190922.6688120\r\nTyphoid fever - Australia: ex Pakistan, multidrug resistance 20190918.6679904\r\nTyphoid fever - Pakistan (03): (SD) multidrug resistance 20190626.6539573\r\nTyphoid fever - Denmark: ex Pakistan, multidrug resistance 20190524.6483641\r\nTyphoid fever - USA (02): (MA) food worker, imported 20190522.6480973\r\nTyphoid fever - Pakistan (02): (SD) multidrug resistance 20190220.6326968\r\nTyphoid fever - Pakistan: multidrug resistance 20190212.6313110\r\nTyphoid fever - USA: ex Pakistan, multidrug resistance, CDC 2018 20190110.6252390]\n.................................................sb/ll/tw/mpp"

As they migrate, they can then spread the disease to new areas.\r\n\r\nA backyard flock of pet chickens in New York's Suffolk County were detected with the flu on 19 Feb [2022]. Following that discovery, some health experts in Connecticut expressed concerns with the strain being found so close to the state.\r\n\r\nIn the past 5 years, low pathogenic avian influenza has been found in Connecticut 3 times, according to the state Department of Agriculture website.\r\n\r\nThe state agency urged any residents who own chicken or other game birds to be aware of the situation and report anything out of the ordinary, DEEP said. Among the signs of avian flu are depression, decreased food and water consumption, decreased egg production, soft or misshapen eggs, and any respiratory signs like coughing or sneezing.\r\n\r\nAnyone who suspects poultry might have died from unknown causes is asked to contact the state veterinarian at 860-713-2505 or <ctstate.vet@ct.gov>.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Tara O'Neill]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\r\n\r\n[ProMED map of Connecticut, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701765,210>]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] Indiana (Dubois County): commercial turkeys\r\nDate: Tue 1 Mar 2022\r\nSource: ABC News [edited]\r\n<https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/state-officials-bird-flu-found-6th-indiana-turkey-83187220>\r\n\r\n\r\nAvian influenza has been detected in a 6th commercial poultry flock in southern Indiana, state officials said Tuesday [1 Mar 2022].\r\n\r\nLaboratory testing of a 4th commercial turkey flock in Dubois County has come back as presumptively positive for the virus, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) said. The samples are being verified at the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa.\r\n\r\nThree previous cases were found in Dubois County and 2 in Greene County. Cases have also been detected in Michigan, in a backyard flock and in a zoo.\r\n\r\nPending test results should indicate if it is the same strain of the virus having been found elsewhere and if it is highly pathogenic.\r\n\r\nOfficials have begun euthanizing the 16 500 birds at the latest farm to prevent the spread of the disease.\r\n\r\nAnimal Health Board staff have reached out to known hobby/backyard poultry owners in the area to schedule testing of birds there, it said.\r\n\r\nThe agency said avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern and no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the US.\r\n\r\nThe turkey infections are the 1st confirmation of highly pathogenic bird flu in commercial poultry in the US since 2020, the US Department of Agriculture has said.\r\n\r\nA January 2016 outbreak of bird flu in Dubois County affected 11 poultry farms, resulting in the loss of more than 400 000 birds, the Animal Health Board said.\r\n\r\nIndiana ranks 3rd nationally in turkey production.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\r\n\r\n[ProMED map of Dubois County, Indiana, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701765,38367>]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[4] Florida (multiple counties): wild birds\r\nDate: Wed 2 Mar 2022\r\nSource: Space Coast Daily [edited]\r\n<https://spacecoastdaily.com/2022/03/florida-department-of-health-confirms-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-in-wild-waterfowl-in-brevard/>\r\n\r\n\r\nAs of 28 Feb [2022], highly pathogenic avian influenza has arrived in Florida via wild waterfowl returning from nesting in the arctic where they comingled with birds from around the world.\r\n\r\nConfirmed cases in wild waterfowl have been reported in Volusia, Brevard, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Palm Beach Counties.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the state is under surveillance.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the Florida Department of Health, as of this writing, no cases of this bird flu have been found in the domestic, backyard, or commercial birds in Florida.\r\n\r\nWild birds, particularly water birds, can carry many strains of low pathogenic avian influenza, most of which do not cause disease in domestic poultry. However, when a low pathogenic strain undergoes a mutation and forms a highly pathogenic strain, the mutated strain can cause significant disease in domestic poultry.\r\n\r\nThe HPAI virus is not easily transmissible from birds to humans, but health officials are concerned it could mutate into another form capable of spreading readily from person to person, triggering a pandemic.\r\n\r\nNo cases of human infections with HPAI have been reported in the United States as of this writing. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) considers the current risk to the public to be low.\r\n\r\nAs risk depends on exposure, it is best to not touch sick or dead wild birds. If such instances are necessary, persons handling such wild birds should use personal protective equipment such as protective clothing, rubber boots, gloves, eye protection, and face shields.\r\n\r\nAfter handling the bird, these items can be disinfected with a 10% bleach water solution. Report wild bird mortalities to <http://app.myfwc.com/FWRI/AvianMortality/>.\r\n\r\nTo keep domestic, backyard, and commercial flocks free of this virus, it is recommended all poultry (chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, etc.) be housed inside a coop with a solid roof and steps be taken to prevent wild birds from entering the coop.\r\n\r\nIt is also recommended to limit visits to your coop to only those who regularly handle your poultry. Report sick or dead birds to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) or your veterinarian.\r\n\r\nTo help in the tracking of HPAI,\r\n- report sick or dead commercial or backyard birds to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (<FDACS.gov>) or your veterinarian;\r\n- report wild bird mortalities to <http://app.myfwc.com/FWRI/AvianMortality/>.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[ProMED map of Florida, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701765,212>]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[5] Iowa (Pottawattamie County): non-commercial poultry\r\n\r\nDate: Wed 2 Mar 2022 6:50 p.m. CST\r\nSource: KCCI [edited]\r\n<https://www.kcci.com/article/highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-detected-in-iowa/39296786>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) on Wednesday [2 Mar 2022] confirmed a positive case of highly pathogenic bird flu in Pottawattamie County.\r\n\r\n\"This is certainly not welcomed news, but it's not unexpected,\" says Mike Naig, Secretary of Agriculture. The Iowa Department of Agriculture reports the virus was found in a non-commercial, backyard flock of 42 chickens and ducks.\r\n\r\n\"After the notification of any high-path avian influenza case, we always immediately quarantine,\" says Dr. Jeff Kaisand, the state veterinarian. \"The flock in question was put in quarantine. All birds at the positive site have been depopulated, and disposal has occurred.\"\r\n\r\nThe recent bird flu detections in birds do not present an immediate public health concern for humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\r\n\r\n\"We recognize the threat HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) and other foreign animal diseases pose to Iowa agriculture,\" Secretary Mike Naig said in a news release. \"We have been working with USDA, livestock producers, and other stakeholders to develop, test, and strengthen our foreign animal disease preparedness and response plans since the 2015 HPAI outbreak. While a case like this is not unexpected, we are working with USDA and other partners to implement our plans and protect the health of poultry flocks in Iowa.\"\r\n\r\nBird flu is often fatal for birds, and the warmer temperatures pose an increased threat of more positive cases in the state.\r\n\r\n\"The virus does appear to be very prevalent in wild birds, so the next few months during the time of northern migration and the Mississippi fly away will be a time of high alert for all poultry owners,\" said Naig.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture department said biosecurity resources and best practices are available at\r\n <http://www.iowaagriculture.gov/biosecurity>.\r\n\r\nSigns of HPAI include the following:\r\n- sudden increase in bird deaths without any clinical signs\r\n- lack of energy and appetite\r\n- decrease in egg production\r\n- soft- or thin-shelled or misshapen eggs\r\n- swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles, and hocks\r\n- purple discoloration of the wattles, comb, and legs\r\n- gasping for air (difficulty breathing)\r\n- coughing, sneezing, and/or nasal discharge (runny nose)\r\n- stumbling or falling down\r\n- diarrhea\r\n\r\n[Byline: Scott Carpenter]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n[ProMED map of Pottawattamie County, Iowa, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701765,13633>]\n\n[Avian influenza continues to move across the United States. Everyone must be diligent about biosecurity of the birds. Be on the alert for ill birds in your flock, and if you are a hunter, take notice if there are ill birds in flocks you may be hunting. If you are able, bring your birds inside. They can be in your garage or something like a back room. Even in winter, birds will need some type of ventilation, so a fan may be needed, but, of course, severe cold is always an issue as well. The point is to do what is necessary to protect your birds.\r\n\r\nMigrating birds can transport the virus without the migratory bird appearing to be ill. So this is a time to be very vigilant about all birds near your flock. - Mod.TG]\n\n[See Also:\nAvian influenza (57): Americas (USA) mixed poultry, captive bird, HPAI H5N1 20220302.8701740\r\nAvian influenza (53): Americas (USA) wild bird, poultry, HPAI H5N1 20220225.8701648\r\nAvian influenza (45): Americas (USA) poultry, mixed flock, HPAI H5N1 20220215.8701469\r\nAvian influenza (43): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220214.8701447\r\nAvian influenza (41): Americas (USA) HPAI H5N1, OIE 20220211.8701404\r\nAvian influenza (40): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220210.8701387\r\nAvian influenza (39): Americas (USA) turkey, HPAI H5N1 20220209.8701372\r\nAvian influenza (36): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220208.8701339\r\nAvian influenza (34): Americas (Canada) poultry, HPAI H5N1, OIE 20220204.8701269\r\nAvian influenza (33): Americas (Canada) domestic geese, HPAI H5N1 20220204.8701238\r\nAvian influenza (32): Americas (Canada) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220202.8701217\r\nAvian influenza (30): Americas (USA) wild bird 20220201.8701178\r\nAvian influenza (22): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220120.8700990\r\nAvian influenza (19): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5, OIE 20220117.8700932\r\nAvian influenza (15): Americas (Canada) poultry 20220114.8700858\r\nAvian influenza (04): Americas (Canada) wild bird 20220103.8700643\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (185): Canada (NL) captive bird, HPAI H5N1, OIE 20211227.8700523\r\nAvian influenza (181): Canada (NL) H5N1, poultry 20211225.8700481\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (39): USA (SC) poultry, HPAI H7N3 20200410.7206731\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (79): USA (TN): poultry, HPAI H7N9 20170317.4908223\r\nAvian influenza (78): USA poultry, (AL) H7, (TN) H7N9, both LPAI 20170317.4906690\r\nAvian influenza (71): USA (WI) turkey, HPAI H7N9 20170311.4893871\r\nAvian influenza (69): USA (TN) poultry, HPAI H7N9 20170309.4888517\r\nAvian influenza (67): USA (TN) poultry, HPAI H7, OIE 20170307.4883078\r\nAvian influenza (66): USA (TN) poultry, HPAI, H7 20170305.4881365\r\n2016\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (15): USA (IN) poultry, HPAI & LPAI H7N8 20160121.3953508\r\nAvian influenza (11): USA (IN) poultry, HPAI/LPAI H7N8 20160120.3950429\r\nAvian influenza (08): USA (IN) poultry, HPAI revised to LPAI H7N8, update 20160118.3944747\r\n2015\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (164): USA (GA) HPAI H5N2, poultry, proactive prevention 20150620.3452030\r\nAvian influenza (151): USA (MN,IA) HPAI H5N2, poultry 20150606.3414670\r\nAvian influenza (141): USA: (MN) HPAI H5N2, poultry 20150531.3397688\r\nAvian influenza (120): USA, HPAI H5N2, poultry, turkey 20150510.3352747\r\nAvian influenza (87): USA, HPAI H5N2, turkey, poultry 20150418.3305689\r\nAvian influenza (80): USA, HPAI H5N2, turkey, poultry 20150415.3298419\r\nAvian influenza (74): USA (MN,ND) HPAI H5N2, turkey 20150412.3292191\r\nAvian influenza (59): USA (MN): turkey, H5N2 20150329.3264089]\n.................................................sb/tg/tw/mpp"

It still prevents severe illness in the children but offers virtually no protection against infection, even within a month after full immunization, the data, which were collected during the omicron surge, suggest.\r\n\r\nThe sharp drop in the vaccine's performance in young children may stem from the fact that they receive one-third the dose given to older children and adults, researchers and federal officials who have reviewed the data said. The findings, which were posted online on Monday [28 Feb 2022], come on the heels of clinical trial results indicating that the vaccine fared poorly in children aged 2-4 years, who received an even smaller dose.\r\n\r\nExperts worried that the news would further dissuade hesitant parents from immunizing their children. Other studies have shown the vaccine was not powerfully protective against infection with the omicron variant in adults, either. \"It's disappointing, but not entirely surprising, given this is a vaccine developed in response to an earlier variant,\" said Eli Rosenberg, deputy director for science at the New York State Department of Health, who led the study. \"It looks very distressing to see this rapid decline, but it's again all against omicron.\"\r\n\r\nStill, he and other public health experts said they recommend the shot for children given the protection against severe disease shown even in the new data set. \"We need to make sure we emphasize the doughnut and not the hole,\" said Dr. Kathryn M. Edwards, a pediatric vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University.\r\n\r\nIn their study, Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues analyzed data from 852 384 newly fully vaccinated children aged 12-17 years and 365 502 children aged 5-11 years between 13 Dec 2021 and 31 Jan 2022, the height of the omicron surge.\r\n\r\nThe vaccine's effectiveness against hospitalization declined to 73% from 85% in the older children. In the younger children, effectiveness dropped to 48% from 100%. But because few children were hospitalized, these estimates have wide margins of error.\r\n\r\nThe numbers for protection from infection are more reliable. Vaccine effectiveness against infection in the older children decreased to 51% from 66%. But in the younger children, it dropped sharply to just 12% from 68%.\r\n\r\nThe numbers change drastically between ages 11 and 12. During the week ending 30 Jan 2022, the vaccine's effectiveness against infection was 67% in 12-year-olds but just 11% in 11-year-old children. \"The difference between the 2 age-groups is striking,\" said Florian Krammer, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.\r\n\r\nThe biological difference between the 2 ages is likely to be minimal, but while 12-year-old children got 30 micrograms of the vaccine -- the same dose given to adults -- children who were 11 received only 10 micrograms, he noted. \"This is super interesting because it would almost suggest that it's the dose that makes the difference,\" he added. \"The question is how to fix that.\"\r\n\r\nThere have been at least 851 deaths involving COVID-19 in children under 17, and nearly 7000 cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, a rare but serious condition associated with COVID. More children were hospitalized during the omicron surge than at any other point in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nThe findings underscore the need to gather more information on the best dose, number and timing for the shots given to children, Dr. Rosenberg said. They also underscore vaccines as just one measure of protection from the virus, along with masks and social distancing, he said.\r\n\r\nDr. Rosenberg's research was posted just days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new recommendations that would allow the majority of Americans to stop wearing masks, including in schools. The new data also raise important questions about the Biden administration's strategy for vaccinating children. Only about 1 in 4 children aged 5-11 years has received 2 doses of the vaccine. (The CDC has not yet recommended booster doses for this age-group.)\r\n\r\nThe vaccine has not yet been authorized for children younger than 5. Scientific advisers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were scheduled to meet on 15 Feb 2022 to evaluate 2 doses of the vaccine for the youngest children, while 3 doses were still being tested. But the meeting was postponed after Pfizer submitted additional data suggesting 2 doses were not strongly protective against the omicron variant of the virus.\r\n\r\nDr. Rosenberg briefed top CDC officials, including Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the agency's director, with findings in early February [2022]. FDA leaders learned of the data around the same time. Some federal scientists pushed for the data to be made public ahead of the FDA expert meeting scheduled for 15 Feb 2022, viewing it as highly relevant to the discussion about dosing in children under 5, federal officials and others familiar with their responses to it said.\r\n\r\nThe data are generally consistent with a report from Britain showing that vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection in adolescents aged 12-17 years drops to 23% after 2 months. The CDC has been compiling its own data on the vaccine's effectiveness in younger children and is expected to release at least some of it as early as this week, according to people familiar with the agency's plans.\r\n\r\nIsraeli researchers have also been assessing the vaccine's performance in young children since the country made it available to them in November [2021]. \"We continue to study and assess real-world data from the vaccine,\" Amy Rose, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said in response to queries about the new data.\r\nDr. Philip Krause, who recently retired from the FDA as a senior vaccine regulator, said assumptions about certain antibody levels being predictive of vaccine effectiveness should be re-evaluated in light of the new results. \"It certainly weakens the argument for mandating that people get that lower dose,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual for experts to revisit the dosing and interval for pediatric vaccines as more evidence becomes available. But in this case, giving the children a higher dose to kick up the immune response may not be an option because some data suggest that it may cause too many fevers, an unwelcome and potentially dangerous side effect in young children.\r\n\r\nThere are other alternatives that may improve immunity in young children, said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona.\r\n\r\nPfizer and BioNTech are testing a 3rd dose in children under 5, as well as in those aged 5-11, with the idea that, as in adults, an extra shot may significantly augment immunity. Results from these trials are expected in several weeks. Studies in adults suggest that 3 doses of the vaccine were more protective against the omicron variant than 2 doses.\r\n\r\nDr. Bhattacharya said he and his wife spaced the 2 doses for their children, who are 8 and 10, by 8 weeks rather than the currently recommended 3, based on studies suggesting that a longer gap between doses may improve protection. The CDC last week encouraged some people older than 12, especially boys and men between 12-39 years, to wait 8 weeks between the 1st and 2nd shot.\r\n\r\nAnother option may be a version of the vaccine designed to thwart the omicron variant, or one that has a mix of several variants. Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson are all testing omicron-specific versions of their vaccines.\r\n\r\nThe next variant may differ widely from omicron, much as omicron did from the delta variant. But training the body to recognize multiple versions would still offer a better chance at preventing infection with newer forms of the virus. \"Deciding when and how best to update these vaccines, I think that's really still the key conversation going forward here,\" Dr. Bhattacharya said.\r\n\r\nNewer vaccines that use different approaches than the ones currently authorized in the United States may also work better for children. A protein-based vaccine made by Novavax is under review at the FDA, and the pharmaceutical companies Sanofi and GSK said this month [February 2022] that they plan to submit their vaccine for evaluation soon.\r\n\r\nMany parents want to vaccinate their children to prevent them from spreading the virus to vulnerable relatives, to keep them in school or to avoid the possibility of long COVID, the poorly understood set of lingering symptoms that can occur even after a mild infection. Experts acknowledged that the vaccine's low effectiveness against infection does not ease those concerns.\r\n\r\nStill, the vaccines \"provide more protection than we think,\" said Jessica Andriesen, a vaccine data expert at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. \"They may also make it so that your kid who brings home COVID isn't shedding virus as much as they would be if they weren't vaccinated, and they also may have it for a shorter amount of time,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe virus is here to stay, and children's risk of severe outcomes increases with age. So inoculating children early is a good idea, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and an adviser to the FDA. \"The argument I make to parents when I talk to them about this vaccine is, your children are going to grow up,\" he said. \"They're going to need to be protected against this virus for years.\"\r\n\r\n[Byline: Apoorva Mandavilli and Noah Weiland]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\r\n\r\n---\r\n[B] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\r\nDate: Tue 1 Mar 2022\r\nSource: STAT [edited]\r\n<https://www.statnews.com/2022/03/01/cdc-data-suggest-pfizer-vaccine-protection-holds-up-in-kids-5-11-raising-questions-on-earlier-study/>\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine provide less protection to children aged 5-11 than to adolescents 12-17? A study from New York State released Monday [28 Feb 2022] suggests that's the case. But new data from 10 states released Tuesday [1 Mar 2022] tell a different story.\r\n\r\nThe data, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), suggest that 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine aren't very protective against infection for either age-group in the face of the omicron variant, but that protection against severe illness appears to be holding up equally in both sets of children (<https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7109e3.htm>).\r\n\r\nThey do not suggest more rapid waning, or more marked waning, among the younger group of children. \"When you look at the whole picture, we're not seeing that signal that New York State is seeing,\" Ruth Link-Gelles, the CDC's program manager for COVID vaccine efficacy studies, told STAT in an interview.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the study, published in the CDC's journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the agency was to post statistics from other datasets on its website Tuesday [1 Mar 2022] afternoon. The various data sources tell the same story, Link-Gelles said. \"They're seeing actually very similar rates of disease among the 5-11-year-olds and the 12-15s. Where they see the difference is between the unvaccinated and vaccinated.\"\r\n\r\nOn Monday [28 Feb 2022], a preprint -- a scientific paper that has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal -- was posted on a server by researchers with the New York State Department of Health [see section [A] above]. Those data show a rapid and substantial decline in protection after vaccination in children in the younger age-group, with efficacy against infections dropping off more quickly and dramatically than the declines seen in children aged 12-17. The study also found a significant, but less steep, decline in protection against hospitalizations.\r\n\r\nThe researchers noted a sharp difference in the protection seen in 11-year-olds and 12-year-olds, children on either side of the divide between the pediatric dose of the Pfizer vaccine and the adult dose. Adults get 2 shots 21 days apart; each jab contains 30 micrograms of vaccine; for the purpose of dosing, anyone 12 years of age and older is an adult. Children 5-11 get 2 doses on the same schedule, but their jabs contain one-third as much vaccine, 10 micrograms, as the adult dose.\r\n\r\n\"Our data support vaccine protection against severe disease among children 5-11 years, but suggest rapid loss of protection against infection, in the omicron variant era,\" the New York State researchers wrote. \"Should such findings be replicated in other settings, review of the dosing schedule for children 5-11 years appears prudent.\"\r\n\r\nSTAT requested an interview with Eli Rosenberg, the senior author of the New York State paper. But he was not made available.\r\n\r\nIn the study published by the CDC, vaccine effectiveness against emergency department or urgent care visits during the time when the omicron variant was circulating was between 34% and 45% for adolescents ages 12-17 and 51% for children ages 5-11. Vaccination of children aged 5-11 only began in November [2021] so they were likely more recently vaccinated -- with higher antibody levels -- than children aged 12-17 during that period.\r\n\r\nKathryn Edwards, a vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University, said she is not yet convinced the dose used in 5-11-year-olds was too low. Rather, Edwards said, what's clear from both studies is that in both the younger and older children, 2 doses of vaccine are not enough to fend off omicron-variant SARS-CoV-2 viruses.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think that there really are any data to suggest that the 5-11-year-olds [are] much worse off than the 12-15-year-olds, with the omicron predominance,\" Edwards said. \"I think that the better part of valor is to say that we need to look at data from more than a single source.\"\r\n\r\n\"The data from New York suggested that there was poor protection for the 5-11-year-olds but certainly this,\" she said, referring to the CDC published paper, \"would not suggest this.\"\r\n\r\nBoth Edwards and Link-Gelles said more study, over a longer period of time, is going to be needed to get a true sense of how well the Pfizer vaccine is working in children. \"I think it's very early to be making the kind of conclusion that they did,\" Link-Gelles said about the New York State paper.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Helen Branswell]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] Vulnerable populations: health outcomes\r\nDate: Tue 1 Mar 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/dementia-patients-died-higher-rates-during-pandemic>\r\n\r\n\r\nMedicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia -- particularly nursing home residents and racial minorities -- died at higher rates than others during the COVID-19 pandemic, finds a large study published yesterday [28 Feb 2022] in JAMA Neurology (<https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2789614>).\r\n\r\nA team led by Dartmouth researchers conducted a retrospective study of 53 640 888 Medicare enrollees 65 years or older enrolled in 100% fee-for-service Medicare Parts A and B from 1 Jan 2019 through 31 Dec 2020. Participants were classified into 1 of 4 categories based on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) status and residence in a nursing home.\r\n\r\nThe study authors noted that excess deaths include both those caused by COVID-19 and those related to pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare services, decreased access to community support services, social isolation and loneliness, and caregiver burnout.\r\n\r\nOf the 26 952 752 patients diagnosed as having ADRD in 2019, 63.5% were women, 2.7% were Asian, 9.2% were Black, 5.7% were Hispanic, and 80.7% were White; the composition changed little among the 26 688 136 patients diagnosed in 2020.\r\n\r\nCompared with 2019, the death rate was 12.4% higher among Medicare enrollees without ADRD and 25.7% higher among those with ADRD in 2020. Among nursing home residents without ADRD, the death rate was 24% higher, but it was 33% higher among nursing home residents with ADRD.\r\n\r\nADRD patients saw a 13.3% greater risk of death than non-ADRD patients from March through December 2020. Racial minorities with ADRD had even higher death rates, at 36% for Asian, 36.7% for Black, and 40.1% for Hispanic participants.\r\n\r\nThe hospital referral region in the lowest quintile for COVID-19 infections in 2020 had no excess deaths in participants without ADRD but an 8.8% higher death rate in community-dwelling enrollees with ADRD and a 14.2% higher rate in nursing home residents with ADRD.\r\n\r\nThe death rate of ADRD patients in Ridgewood, New Jersey, rose by 104.4%, while it was 110.1% in the Bronx, New York. Philadelphia saw a 62% increase in death rates, despite being in the 3rd-lowest quintile for COVID-19 cases.\r\n\r\nAlthough rates of COVID-19 diagnosis from early and late 2020 tripled across all quintiles, death rates among ADRD patients didn't rise across all quintiles of COVID-19 exposure.\r\n\r\nExcess deaths among older ADRD patients early in the pandemic likely resulted from many factors, including their vulnerability to severe COVID-19 infections and disruptions in healthcare, the researchers said. \"Because older adults in general and older adults with cognitive impairments are less able to engage effectively with standard telehealth platforms, it is not difficult to imagine how the combination of less effective (or absent) outpatient care and lower inpatient admission rates led to higher mortality,\" they wrote.\r\n\r\n\"The elevated mortality risk was found early in the pandemic even in areas with very low COVID-19 infection rates, suggesting that older adults with ADRD, especially those in racial and ethnic minority groups and those living in nursing homes, may be particularly susceptible to changes in healthcare delivery and nursing home care during the 'lockdowns' and other restrictions during the pandemic,\" the authors concluded.\r\n\r\nIn a Dartmouth news release, lead author Lauren Gilstrap, MD, MPH, said that dementia patients are a unique population (<https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/944897>). \"Our findings also highlight that as a healthcare system we really do have to think about people with cognitive limitations differently, and that more creative solutions are needed to better serve this highly vulnerable segment of society,\" she said.\r\n\r\nIn a related editorial, JAMA Neurology Viewpoints Editor Elan Guterman, MD, of the University of California at San Francisco, said that the study findings show that preventable death among older dementia patients results from a failure to mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 on the healthcare system and on daily life (<https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2789616>).\r\n\r\n\"Health outcomes among individuals with dementia are closely tied to their base of support because they rely so heavily on social services and informal caregiving to meet their daily needs,\" she wrote. Many populations have borne the brunt of the pandemic, including older non-White people with or without dementia, Guterman noted.\r\n\r\n\"We strive to build a health system that reduces, not enlarges, health disparities,\" she wrote. \"To this end, we must explicitly acknowledge that certain individuals are more susceptible to both the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 and that improving health in these populations includes preventing infection.\"\r\n\r\nGuterman called for a more holistic approach to reducing disease and death among vulnerable populations. \"Policies that fail to repair the anemic social networks and patchy medical care resulting from COVID-19 are undeniably incomplete,\" she concluded.\r\n\r\n\"As COVID-19 turns from pandemic to endemic, it is time to consider how we might apply a more nuanced approach to evaluating risks and benefits of our health policy measures to combat this pandemic and others to come.\"\r\n\r\n[Byline: Mary Van Beusekom]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n[COVID has exacerbated existing health disparities that must be addressed: \"The investigators found that mortality was 24% higher among individuals with ADRD in 2020 compared to 2019, and 14% higher for people without ADRD.

Last year [2021], 4 people died of leptospirosis.

Last year [2021], [there were] 229 cases. \"It is a disease that is found more frequently at the beginning of the year. This disease must be diagnosed early enough, so that it can be treated as quickly as possible,\" explains St\u00e9phane Chabaud, leptospirosis nurse.\r\n\r\n\"The time between when we are exposed and when we develop clinical signs [the incubation period] varies, roughly, from one to 3 weeks. At the start of the disease, the signs can resemble other diseases, such as dengue and COVID-19. If we wait, jaundice may appear,\" adds Dr Anne Pfannstiel, prevention doctor at Dass-NC (Directorate of the health and social agency).\r\n\r\n\"We have a resurgence of cases, usually in the 1st half of the year. In 1999, we had 19 deaths due to leptospirosis,\" she continues. In 2 months in 2022, 63 cases have been recorded. \"It's huge, with 22 children affected. 2/3 of the cases concern the North Province,\" specifies the doctor. The province of the Loyalty Islands is, on the contrary, spared. Since January [2022], the youngest patient reported is 6 years old and the oldest is 71 years old. The greatest caution is therefore recommended, especially since this disease can be avoided.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Martine Nollet (G\u00e9d\u00e9on Richard)]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for this submission.\r\n\r\nNew Caledonia (pop., 271 407 in 2019), a French overseas territory, is an archipelago, located east of Australia, north of New Zealand, south of the Equator, and just west of Fiji and Vanuatu; it includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, and smaller islands and is divided into 3 provinces -- the North and South Provinces are on the main island, while the Loyalty Islands Province is a series of islands east of the main island (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia>). \r\n\r\nLeptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide and is transmitted to humans by exposure to soil or freshwater contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.\r\n\r\nHeavy rainfall affected New Caledonia from Tropical Cyclone Dovi on 10 Feb 2022 (<https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/461257/tropical-cyclone-dovi-causes-major-flooding-in-vanuatu>).

In North America, there is evidence of spillover of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to white-tailed deer, but no evidence of transmission from deer to humans. Through a multidisciplinary research collaboration for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in Canadian wildlife, we identified a new and highly divergent lineage of SARS-CoV-2. This lineage has 76 consensus mutations including 37 previously associated with non-human animal hosts, 23 of which were not previously reported in deer. There were also mutational signatures of host adaptation under neutral selection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed an epidemiologically linked human case from the same geographic region and sampling period. Together, our findings represent the 1st evidence of a highly divergent lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in white-tailed deer and of deer-to-human transmission.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n[White-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) is the cervid most widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains. The ACE2 receptor (where SARS-CoV-2 binds to enter the cell) of white-tailed deer is very similar to that of humans, and it was experimentally proven that after intranasal inoculation, deer become infected by SARS-CoV-2, shed the virus, and transmit it to non-inoculated contact deer. Later on, many wild white-tailed deer populations across USA and Canada were found infected at high prevalences with several SARS-CoV-2 variants. These consistent findings strongly suggest that following the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 from humans, transmission is occurring among deer in the wild at a rate that makes deer populations a suitable compartment where the virus may be maintained and evolve, and then perhaps spill back to humans or other animals as a new variant.\r\n\r\nThis new evidence shows that viral evolution is taking place in white-tailed deer, and it also suggests spill-back may be occurring. The significance of this new variant to public health largely depends on its transmissibility and pathogenicity in humans, so surveillance and research efforts should prioritize the production of data relevant to those traits. - Mod.PMB\n\nProMED map:\nUnited States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701773,106>]\n\n[See Also:\nCOVID-19 update (43): animal, USA, wild deer, omicron 20220209.8701357\r\nCOVID-19 update (451): animal, USA, wild deer 20211230.8700589 \r\nCOVID-19 update (413): animal, Canada, wild deer 20211202.8700020\r\nCOVID-19 update (373): animal, USA, wild deer, transmission 20211102.8699412\r\nCOVID-19 update (260): animal, USA, wild deer, exposure, RFI 20210729.8554149\r\nCOVID-19 update (20): animal, deer, experimental infection\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nCOVID-19 update (536): animal, USA (UT) wild mink, 1st case 20201213.8015608]\n.................................................pmb/ao/mpp"

A collaboration has been established between the Nigerian National Root Crops Research Institute (NRCRI) and Cornell University to combat TLB epidemics across West Africa. \r\n\r\nThe research is to use QTL analysis [see comment below] to determine genetic variation for TLB in locally relevant taro varieties, with the aim to identify superior genotypes that both have high TLB resistance and provide good yields. Furthermore, it will attempt to identify beneficial sequences that may contribute to TLB resistance or tolerance in the host and could be used to develop improved taro varieties.\r\n\r\n[Project description: <https://ilci.cornell.edu/taro-leaf-blight/>]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Taro (_Colocasia esculenta_) leaf blight (TLB) caused by the oomycete (fungus-like organism) _Phytophthora colocasiae_ was first reported in Java in the early 1900s. Since then, it has been found in various parts of Asia and the Pacific; in 2010, it was reported for the 1st time from Africa (see ProMED post 20100715.2365). Both leaves and tubers of the crop are affected. TLB results in yield losses of 30-50 percent or even total crop losses. The disease also reduces the quality of the harvest.\r\n\r\nSymptoms include purple-brown water-soaked lesions on leaves oozing a clear yellow liquid; lesions enlarge and eventually destroy entire leaves in 10-20 days, leading to reduced photosynthesis and plant vigour. Disease development and spread are favoured by free water collecting on older leaves, high temperatures and high humidity. The pathogen can be spread by wind, splashing rain and mechanical means (including insects and human activities). Spores survive in plant material for several weeks and, therefore, infected planting material (seed tubers) is a common means of pathogen spread over long distances and between seasons.\r\n\r\nVarying levels of disease intensity in different areas have led to the suggestion that different strains of _P. colocasiae_ may exist, in addition to differences in the genetic background of local taro varieties. Some of these strains appear to be able to infect some other aroid crops (for example _Alocasia_ species) as well, but further information is needed on whether non-aroid crops like yam (_Dioscorea_ species) and cassava (_Manihot esculenta_) could be affected by these pathogens.\r\n\r\nDisease management using an integrated approach has been successful in the Pacific, including cultural methods (such as crop rotation, intercropping), fungicides as sprays or treatments for seed tubers, phytosanitation and use of cultivars with reduced levels of susceptibility. Programmes specific to different areas for the assessment of taro blight resistance levels of local cultivars have been set up by some countries.\r\n\r\nIn Nigeria, a resistance breeding programme was established in 2011 by the National Root Crops Research Institute (see ProMED post 20110422.1253). The project described above presumably falls within that ongoing work.\r\n\r\nQuantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis uses statistics to link phenotypic and molecular genetic data. It may be used to explain the roles and impacts of particular genetic loci within specific complex biological systems, such as host-pathogen interactions in the project above (see link below for further information on QTL analysis).\r\n\r\nMaps\r\nNigeria:\r\n<https://i.infopls.com/images/mnigeria.gif> and\r\n<http://www.inecnigeria.org/wp-content/themes/inec/images/inec_nigeria.png> (states)\r\nAfrica (overview):\r\n<http://ontheworldmap.com/africa/africa-political-map.jpg>\r\n\r\nPictures\r\nTaro leaf blight symptoms:\r\n<https://live.staticflickr.com/7449/12865162025_0217ecd225_b.jpg>,\r\n<https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2595/5815756226_d51c9f6f77_b.jpg>,\r\n<https://www.plantprotection.org/wp-content/uploads/Taro-leaf-blight-Samoa.jpg>,\r\n<https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/disandpath/oomycete/pdlessons/Article%20Images/TaroLeafBlight03.jpg> (lesion close up),\r\n<https://apps.lucidcentral.org/pppw_v10/images/entities/taro_leaf_blight_014/8719_gwaiau_undersurfaa07a.jpg> (leaf underside) and\r\n<http://www.extento.hawaii.edu/kbase/view/files/pictures/Img0007.jpg> (compared with healthy leaf)\r\n\r\nLinks\r\nInformation on taro leaf blight:\r\n<https://apps.lucidcentral.org/ppp/text/web_full/entities/taro_leaf_blight_014.htm>,\r\n<http://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/fungi/Oomycetes/Pages/TaroLeafBlight.aspx> (with pictures), \r\n<https://www.plantwise.org/knowledgebank/datasheet/40955>,\r\n<http://www.papuaweb.org/dlib/tema/ubi/paiki-1996-taro-leaf-blight.pdf> and via\r\n<https://www.plantprotection.org/taro-leaf-blight/>\r\nInformation on _P. colocasiae_:\r\n<http://www.extento.hawaii.edu/kbase/crop/type/p_coloc.htm>\r\n_P. colocasiae_ taxonomy:\r\n<http://www.indexfungorum.org/names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=232219>\r\nBackground information on QTL analysis:\r\n<https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/quantitative-trait-locus-qtl-analysis-53904/>\r\nNRCRI:\r\n<https://nrcri.gov.ng/>\r\n- Mod.DHA\n\nProMED map:\nNigeria: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701775,62>]\n\n[See Also:\n2018\r\n----\r\nLeaf blight, taro - Nigeria (02) comment 20181011.6086162\r\nLeaf blight, taro - Nigeria: (KT) 20181008.6076838\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nUndiagnosed disease, taro - Nigeria: (EN) 20170918.5322831\r\nCrop diseases - Philippines: (Cordilleras region) survey 20170718.5185031\r\n2015\r\n----\r\nLeaf blight, taro - Nigeria: (KT) 20151119.3805332\r\n2014\r\n----\r\nLeaf blight, taro - India: (HP) 20140904.2747184\r\n2011\r\n----\r\nLeaf blight, taro - Nigeria: update 20110422.1253\r\n2010\r\n----\r\nLeaf blight, taro - Africa: 1st rep.

The study period was [21 Feb 2020 to 19 Jan 2021], and participants were tracked for, on average, 1.4 years. Average participant age was 43.3 years, 69% were female, 94% were White, and 19% were Latino.\r\n\r\nTen had at least one test confirming neuropathy, including 63% of skin biopsies, 17% of electrodiagnostic tests, and 50% of autonomic function tests. The critically ill patient was diagnosed as having axonal neuropathy, while another had multifocal demyelinating neuropathy 3 weeks after mild illness, and more than 10 had small-fiber neuropathy (SFN). Common neuropathy symptoms were weakness, sensory changes, and pain in the hands and feet, and many patients reported fatigue.\r\n\r\nA total of 35% percent of patients were given corticosteroids or intravenous immune globulins. The 5 patients who received immunoglobulin G appeared to derive a benefit. Over time, 52% of participants improved, but none experienced total resolution.\r\n\r\n\"This report strengthens evidence linking several idiopathic multisymptom conditions--including SFN and fibromyalgia--with dysimmunity, sometimes incident to infections or vaccinations,\" the study authors wrote.\r\n\r\nWhile rigorous clinical trials evaluating specific post-COVID neuropathy treatments haven't been conducted, lead author Mary Louise Oaklander, MD, PhD, said in an MGH press release that COVID survivors with lingering nerve-related symptoms might want to see their primary care physician, neurologist, or neuromuscular specialist. \"Research from our team and others is clarifying what the different types of post-COVID neuropathy are, and how best to diagnose and treat them,\" she said. \"Some patients seem to improve from standard treatments for other immune-related neuropathies.\"\r\n\r\nCitation: Oaklander AL, Mills AJ, Kelley M, et al.

Among the 24 915 patients with IHCA, average age was 64.7\u2009years, 39.5% were women, 24.8% were Black, 61.1% were White, 3.8% were of other races, and 10.3% were of unknown race.\r\n\r\nThe 5916 COVID-19 patients were younger and more often men and of Black race; more likely to have an initial nonshockable rhythm, pneumonia, respiratory insufficiency, or sepsis; and be receiving mechanical ventilation and vasopressors to treat low blood pressure at the time of IHCA.\r\n\r\nRelative to uninfected patients, those with COVID-19 had lower rates of survival to hospital release after IHCA (11.9% vs 23.5%; adjusted relative risk [RR], 0.65) and return of spontaneous circulation (53.7% vs 63.6%; adjusted RR, 0.86). They were also more likely to experience delays in defibrillation (27.7% vs 36.6%; RR, 1.30) but not epinephrine administration.\r\n\r\nThe link between COVID-19 and worse survival after IHCA held true for patients with nonsurgical diagnoses, those in an intensive care unit, and those who received timely defibrillation or epinephrine administration. The authors noted that studies from early in the pandemic reported survival rates of less than 3% among COVID-19 patients who had an IHCA. \"However, these results were from single-center studies that comprised only 295 patients with COVID-19 in hospitals that were overwhelmed early during the pandemic,\" the authors wrote.\r\n\r\nNoting that roughly 1 in 4 patients who experienced IHCA in the study had COVID-19. \"This observation underscores the sizable effect of the pandemic on in-hospital resuscitation,\" they wrote.\r\n\r\nThe study findings, the authors said, are relevant to healthcare providers and hospitals amid the continuing pandemic. \"Because IHCA survival among patients with COVID-19 in this study was not as poor as reported previously, we believe that COVID-19 infection alone should not be used as a criterion for withholding resuscitation care from hospitalized patients,\" they wrote. \r\n\r\n\"As new variants emerge, future studies will be needed to assess the ongoing impact of COVID-19 infection on IHCA survival.\"\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n[Citation: Girotra S, Chan ML, Starks MA, et al Association of COVID-19 Infection With Survival After In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Among US Adults.

Our findings are consistent with those of Hayek et al (12.0% survival in 400 patients with COVID-19 in 68 ICUs) and Mitchell et al (11.9% survival in 260 patients with COVID-19 at 11 hospitals) and extend the previous findings by adding a comparison group of patients without COVID and including non-ICU patients from a larger group of hospitals. We believe that these data will be relevant to health care providers and hospital administrators as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Because IHCA survival among patients with COVID-19 in this study was not as poor as reported previously, we believe that COVID-19 infection alone should not be used as a criterion for withholding resuscitation care from hospitalized patients. ...\" (see publication for references). \r\n- Mod.LK]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] Ivermectin: paper withdrawn\r\nDate: Fri 4 Feb 2022\r\nSource: Socopen [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://socopen.org/tag/covid-19/>\r\n\r\n\r\nOn withdrawing \"Ivermectin and the odds of hospitalization due to COVID-19,\" by Merino et al\r\n\r\n...  there remains insufficient evidence that ivermectin is effective in treating COVID-19; the study is of minimal scientific value at best; the paper is part of an unethical program by the government of Mexico City to dispense hundreds of thousands of doses of an inappropriate medication to people who were sick with COVID-19, which possibly continues to the present; the authors of the paper have promoted it as evidence that their medical intervention is effective. This review is intended to help the SocArXiv Steering Committee reach a decision on the request to remove the paper (we set aside the question of banning the authors from future submissions, which is reserved for people who repeatedly violate our rules). The statement below followed from this review.\r\n\r\nSocArXiv Steering Committee statement on withdrawing the paper by Merino et al. (10.31235/osf.io/r93g4).\r\nThis is the first time we have used our prerogative as service administrators to withdraw a paper from SocArXiv. Although we reject many papers, according to our moderation policy, we don't have a policy for unilaterally withdrawing papers after they have been posted. We don't want to make policy around a single case, but we do want to respond to this situation.\r\n\r\nWe are withdrawing the paper, and replacing it with a \"tombstone\" that includes the paper's metadata. We are doing this to prevent the paper from causing additional harm, and taking this incident as an impetus to develop a more comprehensive policy for future situations. The metadata will serve as a reference for people who follow citations to the paper to our site.\r\n\r\nOur grounds for this decision are several:\r\n1.\tThe paper is spreading misinformation, promoting an unproved medical treatment in the midst of a global pandemic.\r\n2.\tThe paper is part of, and justification for, a government program that unethically dispenses (or did dispense) unproven medication apparently without proper consent or appropriate ethical protections according to the standards of human subjects research.\r\n3.\tThe paper is medical research - purporting to study the effects of a medication on a disease outcome - and is not properly within the subject scope of SocArXiv.\r\n4.\tThe authors did not properly disclose their conflicts of interest.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate that of the thousands of papers we have accepted and now host on our platform, there may be others that have serious flaws as well.\r\n\r\nWe are taking this unprecedented action because this particular bad paper appears to be more important, and therefore potentially more harmful, than other flawed work. In administering SocArXiv, we generally err on the side of inclusivity, and do not provide peer review or substantive vetting of the papers we host. Taking such an approach suits us philosophically, and also practically, since we don't have staff to review every paper fully. But this approach comes with the responsibility to respond when something truly harmful gets through. In light of demonstrable harms like those associated with this paper, and in response to a community groundswell beseeching us to act, we are withdrawing this paper. ...-more\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\nwith thanks to Roland H\u00fcbner for the link \r\n\r\n[It is recommended to read full report at URL above.

A farmer said that the financial impact will be felt for the next 20 to 25 years. Exports of produce are expected to resume shortly.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Potato wart disease (PW) is caused by the fungus _Synchytrium endobioticum_, which is considered one of the most important pathogens of the crop. It is endemic in Europe and has also been reported from a number of locations in the Americas, Australasia and Africa. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some solanaceous weeds. On infected potato tubers, \"eyes\" develop into characteristic warty, cauliflower-like swellings. If infected early, the whole tuber can be replaced by a warty proliferation. Warts darken with age, eventually rot and disintegrate. Plant vigour is reduced, both quantity and quality of harvested tubers are severely affected. Diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation, as similar symptoms can be caused by other pathogens. The fungus goes through cycles of proliferation and re-infection as long as cool, wet conditions prevail and is, therefore, less damaging in warm, light, well-drained soils.\r\n\r\nThe disease is spread with soil (for example on farm tools), by infected seed tubers and also in manure from animals fed on infected potatoes. The fungus can survive in soil for up to 40 years in the absence of a host. Disease management is based on pathogen exclusion by quarantine regulations and the control of local pathogen spread. Use of certified clean seed tubers is crucial; contaminated seed lines pose major risks of losses both in yield and international trade. Fungicides are ineffective, but some experimental fumigation treatments have been shown to kill resting sporangia.\r\n\r\nThere are several pathotypes defined by their virulence on different host cultivars. Potato varieties resistant to a number of them have been developed, but new pathogen strains are emerging, compromising the efficacy of host plant resistance.\r\n\r\nAfter its first detection on PEI in 2000 (ProMED post 20001028.1877), attempts to confine the pathogen to the site of its initial discovery have unfortunately been unsuccessful. New outbreaks were detected previously also in 2007 and 2014 (ProMED posts 20071102.3559 & 20140901.2738758, respectively).\r\n\r\nMaps\r\nCanada (with provinces):\r\n<http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/Canada_Provinces_and_territories_map.png>\r\nPrince Edward Island:\r\n<http://homer.ca/images/peimap.gif>\r\n\r\nPictures\r\nPotato wart symptoms:\r\n<http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z2I9uCcxJIk/T4B8yBdYhMI/AAAAAAAAAow/OtwqNyxejak/s1600/potato+wart+disease.jpg>,\r\n<http://ephytia.inra.fr/en/I/29780/Gale-verruqueuse1> and\r\n<http://www.forestryimages.org/images/768x512/0454023.jpg>\r\n_S. endobioticum_, microscopy:\r\n<https://bugwoodcloud.org/images/768x512/0454042.jpg>\r\n\r\nLinks\r\nAdditional news story:\r\n<https://www.morningagclips.com/canadian-delegation-reaffirms-need-for-disease-testing-to-resume-potato-trade-with-pei/>\r\nInformation on potato wart disease:\r\n<https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/SYNCEN> (with country information),\r\n<https://planthealthportal.defra.gov.uk/assets/factsheets/pwd.pdf>,\r\n<https://www.plantwise.org/KnowledgeBank/Datasheet.aspx?dsid=52315>,\r\n<http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/plaveg/pestrava/synend/tech/synende.shtml>,\r\n<http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070618102406.htm> and\r\n<https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/52315>\r\nPotato wart life cycle:\r\n<http://joelfloydillustration.com/images/pathogens/potatowart_lifecycle_jf.jpg>\r\n_S. endobioticum_ taxonomy:\r\n<http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=120395>\r\n- Mod.DHA\n\nProMED map:\nPrince Edward Island Province, Canada: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701779,270>]\n\n[See Also:\n2021\r\n----\r\nWart disease, potato - Canada: (PE) 20211216.8700302\r\nWart disease, potato - Netherlands: (GR) pathotype 38 20211013.8699028\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nWart disease, potato - Netherlands: (GR) new strain 20201214.8018156\r\nWart disease, potato - Canada: (PE) 20201203.7990992\r\nWart disease, potato - Germany: (NI) 20200223.7017959\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nWart disease, potato - Georgia: pathotype 20191113.6777023\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nWart disease, potato - Ukraine: (IF,CV) 20180716.5908085\r\nWart disease, potato - Sweden, Germany 20180412.5743363\r\nWart & brown rot, potato - Georgia, Russia: interceptions 20180327.5712463\r\n2014\r\n----\r\nWart disease, potato - Denmark: (MJ) 20141008.2844631\r\nWart disease, potato - Canada: (PE) 20140901.2738758\r\n2012\r\n----\r\nWart disease, potato - New Zealand: (SO) 20120924.1306359\r\nWart disease, potato - UK: (N Ireland) eradication 20120820.1252253\r\n2007\r\n----\r\nPotato wart disease - Canada: (PEI), spread 20071102.3559\r\nPale cyst nematode & wart, potato - USA 20070629.2088\r\nand additional items in the archives]\n.................................................sb/dha/may/mpp"

We report 3 cases caused by meningococcus B (MenB) at a Belgian nursery school over 9 months. The first 2 cases of IMD occurred in spring and summer 2018 in healthy children (aged 3-5 years) attending the same classroom [the 2nd case occurred 2 months after the 1st case]. Chemoprophylaxis was given to close contacts of both cases following regional guidelines. The 3rd case, a healthy child of similar age in the same class as a sibling of one case, developed disease in late 2018 [the 3rd case occurred 7 months after the 2nd case]. Microbiological analyses revealed MenB with identical finetype clonal complex 269 for Cases 1 and 3 (unavailable for Case 2) [Case 2 cerebrospinal fluid PCR positive for _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B]. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed no antibiotic resistance. Following Case 3, after multidisciplinary discussion, chemoprophylaxis and 4CMenB (Bexsero) vaccination were offered to close contacts. In the 12-month follow-up of Case 3, no additional cases were reported by the school. IMD outbreaks are difficult to manage and generate public anxiety, particularly in the case of an ongoing cluster, despite contact tracing and management. This outbreak resulted in the addition of MenB vaccination to close contacts in Wallonian regional guidelines, highlighting the potential need and added value of vaccination in outbreak management.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[This report above describes an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) due to meningococcus serogroup B (MenB) involving 3 children in a nursery school in Wallonia, Belgium, in 2018. Within 48 hours after each case occurred, ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis (a single dose of 15 mg/kg) was administered to all close contacts of each case. The strain was fluoroquinolone susceptible. However, the protection conferred by the single dose of ciprofloxacin was only temporary: In this particular nursery school outbreak, the 2nd and 3rd cases occurred several months after having received the chemoprophylaxis dose, suggesting the outbreak strain continued to circulate locally with reintroduction by an asymptomatic carrier of the outbreak strain who had not received antibiotic prophylaxis or who had been recolonized. This prompted the decision to vaccinate 2 nursery school classes after the 3rd case to achieve a more prolonged preventive effect conferred by meningococcal vaccination, in the face of continued transmission of MenB over an extended period.\r\n\r\nIn Wallonia, Belgium, vaccination against invasive meningococcal disease is given routinely only at 15 months of age for meningococcus serogroup C (MenC) (<https://www.expatica.com/be/healthcare/healthcare-basics/vaccinations-in-belgium-105159/#Vaccination-System>). In the USA, the CDC recommends all preteens (11-12 years of age) should receive a quadrivalent vaccine against serogroups A, C, W, and Y (MenACWY), with an MenACWY booster at 16-18 years of age; all teens (16-18 years of age) may also opt to get MenB vaccine (<https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/teen/parent-version-schedule-7-18yrs.pdf>). MenACWY vaccine is given in 2 doses. MenB vaccine is given a 2- or 3-dose series. We are not told the vaccination status of the 3 cases in the nursery outbreak, but presumably they did not receive prior immunization against MenB.\r\n\r\nAccording to the CDC, available data suggest that protection from MenACWY vaccines decreases in many teens within 5 years, so that the 16-year-old MenACWY booster dose is critical to provide protection when they are most at risk for meningococcal disease; data on MenB vaccines suggest that protection also declines within 1 to 2 years after vaccination (<https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mening/hcp/about-vaccine.html>).\r\n\r\nA large decline (over 90%) in the rates of IMD caused by serogroups C, Y, and W was seen in the teen population after introduction of MenACWY vaccine (MenA disease has been very rare in the USA). A large decline of IMD was not seen in other age-groups for which the CDC does not recommend routine MenACWY; this suggests MenACWY vaccines provide protection only to those vaccinated, probably not to the larger, unvaccinated community; that is, MenACWY vaccine does not provide herd immunity (<https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mening/hcp/about-vaccine.html>). MenB vaccines, similarly, do not provide protection to the unvaccinated population (i.e., does not provide herd immunity). The absence of an effect of the vaccine on the unvaccinated population suggested to the Belgian authorities to vaccinate a wider range of close contacts in other classrooms. - Mod.ML\n\nProMED map:\nBelgium: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701800,99>]\n\n[See Also:\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA: (MI) college student, frat party 20220129.8701149\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - UK (02): (England) college students, RFI 20211111.8699590\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - New Zealand: (CA) fatal, college student 20210828.8628864\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (CA) college, sg B 20180930.6061362\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA: (OR) middle school student 20180118.5568890\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA (07): (OR) college, sg B 20171222.5520017\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA (06): (MA) college, sg.B, mass sg.B vaccination 20171130.5475220\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA (06): (OR) college, sg B 20171130.5473532\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA (05): (MA) college, sg.

The centre also said children from the age of 5 and below were the most affected. According to the NCDC, a total of 10 states have reported suspected cholera cases in 2022. The states are Abia, Adamawa, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Borno, Cross River, Kwara, Lagos, Taraba and Zamfara.\r\n\r\nThe centre, in its latest cholera report, stated, \"Of all the suspected cases, 45% are males and 55% are females. Three states, namely, Taraba (201), Borno (88) and Adamawa (56), account for 73% of all cumulative cases. Ten local government areas across the 5 states of Borno, Adamawa, Taraba, Bayelsa and Kwara reported more than 10 cases each in 2022.\"\r\n\r\nThe centre stated, \"Some of the challenges are difficulty in accessing some communities due to security concerns, open defecation in affected communities, and lack of potable drinking water in some rural areas and urban slums. The challenges also include inadequate health facility infrastructure and cholera commodities for management of patients, inadequate trained personnel in states for case management, and poor and inconsistent reporting from states.\"\r\n\r\nThe NCDC added that it would continue training in cholera surveillance, hotspot mapping and developing state-level preparedness and response plans, as well as maintaining communication with and support to states.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Deborah Tolu-Kolawole]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] Cholera - Malawi (Balaka)\r\nDate: Fri 4 Mar 2022\r\nSource: Nyasa Times [edited]\r\n<https://www.nyasatimes.com/ministry-reports-cholera-case-in-machinga/>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Health has reported a cholera case at Machinga District Hospital confirmed on 2 Mar 2022. The patient reported to the facility on 28 Feb 2022, and rigorous investigations revealed cholera in the 57-year-old male patient from Balaka District. A press release signed by Principal Secretary in the ministry, Dr Charles Mwansambo, indicates that this is the 1st case of cholera in the current 2021-2022 cholera season.\r\n\r\nCholera, which is more common during the rainy season, is an acute diarrheal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with a bacterium called _Vibrio cholerae_. Diarrhea with or without vomiting is the main symptom of cholera, which affects both children and adults and can kill within hours if untreated.\r\n\r\n\"The Government of Malawi through the Ministry of Health has put measures in place to prevent and control spread of the outbreak by intensifying surveillance including contact tracing of the index case. In addition, Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaigns have been conducted in cholera hotspot areas as well as distributing chlorine to the communities for water treatment, and sending out cholera control information to all the people through different channels,\" explains Dr Mwansambo in the press release.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry has further reminded all people in the country to go to hospital early if they develop diarrhea or if they are suffering from any other disease, saying medical supplies for treatment of cholera are available in all health facilities.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Phillip Pasula]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\nand \r\nMahmoud Orabi for submitting a similar article\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] Diarrhea - South Africa (Cape Town)\r\nDate: Thu 3 Mar 2022\r\nSource: Independent Online (IOL) [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://bit.ly/3pFxGWh>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City of Cape Town yesterday [2 Mar 2022] announced its clinics had reported a major spike in diarrhea cases amid the surge season. Diarrhea is a fairly common ailment during the warmer months, and it remains one of the biggest threats to children under 5. It is one of the leading causes of death in this age-group in developing countries. Between November and May, the number of diarrhea cases typically increases throughout the population as the warmer weather promotes the spread of germs. This is also known as surge season.\r\n\r\nMayoral committee member for community services and health, Councillor Patricia Van der Ross, said there had been a 70% increase in children younger than 5 presenting with diarrhea at clinics compared to the same time in 2021. \"Surge season data tracks cases of diarrhea, pneumonia and severe acute malnutrition in young children. If these are not diagnosed timely and treated, it can have life-threatening consequences.\r\n\r\n\"The very hot conditions in the city have led to a noticeable increase in the number of children brought to health facilities with symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration,\" Van der Ross said. During January 2021, city clinics dealt with 1710 cases. This increased to 2908 cases during January 2022.\r\n\r\nVan der Ross said the clinics provided services to diagnose and treat diarrhea, pneumonia, malnutrition and a number of other ailments that affect children.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Robin-Lee Francke]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[As stated by Lutwick et al (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:\r\n\r\n\"As reviewed by Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally, glucose or rice powder based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).\r\n\r\n\"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the first 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.\"\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------\r\n1.

The disease has been reported in farms at Sanghar, Jamshoro, Thatta, Sukkur, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Khairpur and Karachi, according to a communique. There are reports of loss of weight and milk production in animals due to the disease.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the disease is Africa, from where it has spread to middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe. Within the region, in recent years there were reports of outbreaks of this disease in Iran, India and some other regional countries.\r\n\r\nThis is a new animal disease in Pakistan, and there is no treatment, medicine or vaccine [see comment] available for it so far. It is transmitted by insects feeding on blood such as certain species of flies and mosquitoes, or ticks. It causes fever, nodules on the skin and can lead to death, though mortality rate has been found less than 5%.\r\n\r\nThe Sindh government and fisheries department have advised the owners of cattle to separate their sick animals from healthy ones, keep sheds clean, prevent animals from mosquitoes and biting insects, use mosquito nets, frequently spray farms, animals and premises with anti-insect sprays. In case of disease, report to local authorities and livestock department.\r\n\r\nHumans are not at risk of developing LSD. It is an [infectious] disease in animals.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no treatment for LSD, non-specific treatment such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs and vitamin injections are usually advised by the authorized veterinary doctors as a secondary treatment.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that consumption of meat and milk from LSDV-affected animals is not dangerous to human health.\r\n\r\nIn need for any advice at the local level, the offices of Additional Director Livestock at each district may be consulted. The office addresses and phone numbers are available on the webpage of the department of Livestock and Fisheries. An additional helpline is being established in the office of Director Animal Husbandry Hyderabad and Deputy Director Livestock Animal Husbandry Karachi.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Muhammad Irfan]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nDr Muhammad Usman Zaheer \r\nDiplomate American College of Veterinary Preventive Medicine\r\n<Zaheer.muhammad.usman@gmail.com>\r\nand\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Dr Muhammad Usman Zaheer and Mahmoud Orabi for their submissions.\r\n\r\nThe clinical diagnosis of LSD in cattle, particularly in susceptible breeds, is sufficient for the application of immediate control measures to prevent its spread. Contrary to the media report, a (live attenuated) vaccine is available and efficient. Once the disease has a foothold in a country, the most effective way to control it is by mass vaccination of cattle.\r\n\r\nLSD, a capripox viral OIE-listed disease originally affecting cattle across Africa with sporadic introductions into neighboring Middle Eastern countries, has spread since 2013 outside the continent with epizootics in Balkan countries, trans-Ural Russia, and throughout Asia.

The case, a child under 5 years old, from Central constituency, Lilongwe district, Central Region, developed acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) on 19 Nov 2021. Two stool specimens were collected for testing on [26 and 27 Nov 2022], and were received at the Regional Reference Laboratory, the National Institute of Communicable Disease (NICD) in South Africa, on 14 Jan 2022, and then forwarded to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC).\r\n\r\nSequencing of the virus was conducted by the NICD on [2 Feb 2022], and the US CDC on [12 Feb 2022] confirmed this case as WPV1. Analysis shows that the current WPV1 isolate in Malawi is genetically linked to a Pakistan sequence detected in 2020 in Sindh province.\r\n\r\nAfrica was declared free of indigenous wild polio in August 2020 after eliminating all forms of wild polio from the region, and in Malawi, the last clinically confirmed WPV case was reported in 1992.\r\n\r\nPublic health response\r\n----------------------\r\n- Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners, including WHO, is supporting the Malawi health authorities to carry out a risk assessment and outbreak response, including supplemental immunization. Surveillance measures are being activated and expanded in Malawi and neighbouring countries to detect potential cases.\r\n\r\n- GPEI Rapid Response Team has been sent to Malawi to support coordination, surveillance, data management, communications, and operations. Partner organizations also sent teams to support emergency operations and innovative vaccination campaign solutions.\r\n\r\nWHO risk assessment\r\n-------------------\r\nPolio is a highly infectious disease, caused by a virus that invades the nervous system and can cause permanent paralysis (approximately one in 200 infections) or death (approximately 2-10% of paralyzed cases). The virus is transmitted by person-to-person, mainly through the faecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (for example, contaminated water or food).\r\n\r\nTwo of the 3 types of wild poliovirus have been eradicated (WPV2 and WPV3), with ongoing global efforts to eradicate WPV1. Currently, wild poliovirus is endemic in 2 countries: Pakistan and Afghanistan. The detection of WPV1 outside the 2 countries where the disease is endemic demonstrates the continuous risk of international spread of the disease until every corner of the world is free of WPV1.\r\n\r\nThe risk at the national level in Malawi is assessed as high given the presence of high population density, low vaccination coverage (< 80%) in many districts and lack of a catch-up campaign for more than 6 years, accumulated susceptible populations, suboptimal AFP surveillance, and lack of environmental surveillance, that may be affecting the ability to ascertain cases. Furthermore, the switch from the trivalent Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) to bivalent OPV in Malawi was completed on 25 Apr 2016, and Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) was introduced on 14 Dec 2018. The most recent supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with a vaccine containing type 2 vaccine were conducted in 2013.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the country is currently affected by tropical storm Ana which may impact the country's response capacity by impairing Polio SIAs and surveillance activities. According to the UN flash update on Malawi tropical storm Ana, as of [11 Feb 2022], there have been 995 072 people affected in 19 districts, 206 people injured, 46 people reported dead, and 18 people are reported still missing. The United Nations and partners are supporting the life-saving emergency flood response (<https://malawi.un.org/sites/default/files/2022-02/Malawi%20Floods%20Flash%20Update%20-%2011%20Feb%202022.pdf>)\r\n\r\nThe risk at the regional level is assessed as moderate given the significant population movement between Mozambique and Malawi, suboptimal vaccination coverage in the neighbouring countries, and suboptimal AFP surveillance activities.\r\n\r\nThe risk at the global level is assessed as low given the existing response capacity in place and the moderately high global polio coverage estimates.\r\n\r\nWHO advice\r\n----------\r\nIt is important that all countries, particularly those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen the surveillance of AFP cases to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and to facilitate a rapid response.\r\n\r\nUnder the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR), countries must investigate and notify any poliovirus isolate, whether the isolate is from AFP cases, AFP contacts or environmental surveillance. Local health authorities should initiate the investigation within 24 hours of a poliovirus isolate being reported.\r\n\r\nIsolation of poliovirus in a previously non-infected area represents an event or outbreak that requires national authorities to complete an immediate risk assessment to inform the type and scale of response. Following initial investigation and risk assessment, national authorities must continue to collect detailed information to update the situation analysis and risk assessment (i.e. results from laboratory investigations, or detailed information on affected communities, etc.). Neighbouring countries/regions must also continue to update their risk assessment with support from WHO regional offices.\r\n\r\nCountries, territories, and areas should also maintain systematically high routine immunization coverage rates (> 90%) both at national and subnational levels to minimize the consequences of any new poliovirus introduction. WHO recommends that 2 high-quality large-scale vaccination campaigns (> 90% of children vaccinated) should be completed within 8 weeks of laboratory sequencing results. A mop-up round might be required as an additional step wherever monitoring suggests children have been missed in certain health districts or areas, to ensure interruption of transmission (even in the absence of new poliovirus detections). Communication and social mobilization activities should be an integrated part of reactive polio immunization campaigns.\r\n\r\nWHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and/or trade to Malawi based on the information available for this current event. WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or IPV within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.\r\n\r\nAs per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remain a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency, consider vaccination of all international travelers, ensure such travelers are provided with an international certificate of vaccination, restrict at the point of departure the international travel of any resident lacking documentation of appropriate polio vaccination, intensify cross-border efforts to substantially increase vaccination coverage of travelers, and intensify efforts to increase routine immunization coverage.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED Rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n[The profile of Malawi's risk of further transmission is sobering. \"The risk at the national level in Malawi is assessed as high given the presence of high population density, low vaccination coverage (< 80%) in many districts and lack of a catch-up campaign for more than 6 years, accumulated susceptible populations, suboptimal AFP surveillance, and lack of environmental surveillance, that may be affecting the ability to ascertain cases. Furthermore, the switch from the trivalent Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) to bivalent OPV in Malawi was completed on 25 Apr 2016, and Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) was introduced on 14 Dec 2018. The most recent supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with a vaccine containing type 2 vaccine were conducted in 2013.\" I suspect this profile is replicated in many countries in the region and in other regions, a sign of fatigue towards continued supplementary activities to increase coverage in the face of having eradicated WPV from the region. The proliferation of cVDPV outbreaks is related to the same high-risk profile as that presented for Malawi and WPV circulation.\r\n\r\nA map of Malawi can be found at: <https://www.worldatlas.com/maps/malawi>. - Mod.MPPn\n\nProMED map:\nMalawi: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701806,176>]\n\n[See Also:\nPoliomyelitis update (07): global AFP, cVDPV1 (Madagascar) cVDPV2 (ES Nigeria) 20220304.8701782\r\nPoliomyelitis update (06): global AFP, WPV1, cVDPV1 & cVDPV2, RFI 20220226.8701660\r\nPoliomyelitis update (05): Guinea-Bissau, cVDPV, RFI 20220218.8701539\r\nPoliomyelitis update (04): cVDPV2 (Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia), WPV1 Malawi 20220218.8701529\r\nPoliomyelitis update (03): WPV1 (AFP Afghanistan), cVDPV2 (AFP; ES Djibouti) 20220212.8701429\r\nPoliomyelitis update (02): global cVDPV1 (ES Madagascar), cVDPV2 (multicountry), 2021 20220129.8701140\r\nPoliomyelitis update (01): WPV1 (ES), cVDPV1+2 (AFP) 2021, COVID 20220103.8700644\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nPoliomyelitis update (25): global cVDPV2 (multicountry) Pakistan violence 20211218.8700356\r\nPoliomyelitis update (24): Yemen, WHO, comment 20211211.8700196\r\nPoliomyelitis update (23): global (WPV1 Afghanistan, cVDPV2 Cameroon, Nigeria) 20211210.8700170\r\nPoliomyelitis update (22): global (WPV1 Afghanistan, cVDPV2 multicountry), IHR 20211129.8699938\r\nPoliomyelitis update (21): global (WPV1 Pakistan ES, cVDPV2 multicountry) 20210904.8644347\r\nPoliomyelitis update (20): global (WPV1, cVDPV2, cVDPV1), Gambia, Uganda 20210821.8612882\r\nPoliomyelitis update (19): global (cVDPV2) Gambia, Pakistan, RFI 20210813.8591368\r\nPoliomyelitis update (18): global (WPV1,cVDPV1,cVDPV2), Pakistan violence 20210808.8577968\r\nPoliomyelitis update (17): global(cVDPV1,cVDPV2 Uganda/Gambia) Pakistan, Nigeria 20210730.8557717\r\nPoliomyelitis update (16): global (cVDPV1, cVDPV2), Nigeria 20210722.8538466\r\nPoliomyelitis update (15): global (cVDPV2), Nigeria 20210715.8522150\r\nPoliomyelitis update (14): Global (WPV1 ES, cVDPV2, cVDPV1) 20210708.8505008\r\nPoliomyelitis update (13): global (cVDPV2 Nigeria, Egypt environmental sample) 20210702.8489890\r\nPoliomyelitis update (12): global (cVDPV2, WPV1 ES) 20210624.8473119\r\nPoliomyelitis update (11): global (cVDPV2), vaccinator violence 20210618.8456569\r\nPoliomyelitis update (10): Senegal, cVDPV2 20210614.8447598\r\nPoliomyelitis update (09): global (WPV1 ES, cVDPV2 AFP cases) RFI 20210611.8442001\r\nPoliomyelitis update (08): global (cVDPV2), Afghanistan 20210603.8421558\r\nPoliomyelitis update (07): global, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Somalia, WHO 20210527.8382587\r\nPoliomyelitis update (06): global, Africa 20210516.8363867\r\nPoliomyelitis update (05): global, Afghanistan campaign, Yemen 20210419.8313248\r\nPoliomyelitis update (04): global, WPV1, cVDPV 20210312.8242333\r\nPoliomyelitis update (03): global, WPV1, cVDPV 20210309.8236114\r\nPoliomyelitis update (02): global, WPV1, cDPV 20210222.8205197\r\nPoliomyelitis update (01): Pakistan, global (Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone) RFI 20210102.8064119\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nPoliomyelitis update (24): global (WPV1; cVDPV2) 20201229.8053858\r\nCOVID-19 update (77): global, polio vacc on hold, new countries, WHO 20200404.7182744\r\nPoliomyelitis update (01): global (WPV1, cVDPV2), Pakistan (KP, SD) 20200103.6869841\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nPoliomyelitis update (106): Pakistan (KP) RFI 20191231.6865382\r\nPoliomyelitis update (01): global 20190104.6241814\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nPoliomyelitis update (62): (Nigeria, Niger) cVDPV2 20181228.6226490\r\nPoliomyelitis update (01): global (Afghanistan) 20180105.5539242\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nPoliomyelitis update (47): Pakistan, global (Congo DR) 20171229.5526565\r\nPoliomyelitis (01): Pakistan (GB), global, RFI 20170314.4898724\r\nand other items in the archives]\n.................................................mpp/may/mpp"

The disease has been reported in farms at Sanghar, Jamshoro, Thatta, Sukkur, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Khairpur and Karachi, according to a communique. There are reports of loss of weight and milk production in animals due to the disease.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the disease is Africa, from where it has spread to middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe. Within the region, in recent years there were reports of outbreaks of this disease in Iran, India and some other regional countries.\r\n\r\nThis is a new animal disease in Pakistan, and there is no treatment, medicine or vaccine [see comment] available for it so far. It is transmitted by insects feeding on blood such as certain species of flies and mosquitoes, or ticks. It causes fever, nodules on the skin and can lead to death, though mortality rate has been found less than 5%.\r\n\r\nThe Sindh government and fisheries department have advised the owners of cattle to separate their sick animals from healthy ones, keep sheds clean, prevent animals from mosquitoes and biting insects, use mosquito nets, frequently spray farms, animals and premises with anti-insect sprays. In case of disease, report to local authorities and livestock department.\r\n\r\nHumans are not at risk of developing LSD. It is an [infectious] disease in animals.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no treatment for LSD, non-specific treatment such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs and vitamin injections are usually advised by the authorized veterinary doctors as a secondary treatment.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that consumption of meat and milk from LSDV-affected animals is not dangerous to human health.\r\n\r\nIn need for any advice at the local level, the offices of Additional Director Livestock at each district may be consulted. The office addresses and phone numbers are available on the webpage of the department of Livestock and Fisheries. An additional helpline is being established in the office of Director Animal Husbandry Hyderabad and Deputy Director Livestock Animal Husbandry Karachi.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Muhammad Irfan]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nDr Muhammad Usman Zaheer \r\nDiplomate American College of Veterinary Preventive Medicine\r\n<Zaheer.muhammad.usman@gmail.com>\r\nand\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Dr Muhammad Usman Zaheer and Mahmoud Orabi for their submissions.\r\n\r\nThe clinical diagnosis of LSD in cattle, particularly in susceptible breeds, is sufficient for the application of immediate control measures to prevent its spread. Contrary to the media report, a (live attenuated) vaccine is available and efficient. Once the disease has a foothold in a country, the most effective way to control it is by mass vaccination of cattle.\r\n\r\nLSD, a capripox viral OIE-listed disease originally affecting cattle across Africa with sporadic introductions into neighboring Middle Eastern countries, has spread since 2013 outside the continent with epizootics in Balkan countries, trans-Ural Russia, and throughout Asia. It has already been reported from the following Asian/South-East Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, China, Bhutan, Nepal, Viet Nam, Taiwan, Myanmar, China (Hong Kong SAR), Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Laos, and Mongolia.

All 4 were admitted to hospital and one has since been discharged.\r\n\r\nJapanese encephalitis virus spreads through mosquito bites and people in regional areas who are in contact with pigs may be at particular risk.\r\n\r\nThe disease is not transmitted from person to person and cannot be caught by eating pork or pig products.\r\n\r\nAustralia's health department confirmed the disease had been found in one piggery in Victoria's north, 6 piggeries in NSW and one in Queensland.\r\n\r\n\"This is the first time the virus has been detected in southern Australia, and biosecurity authorities are working with their human health departments to understand the implications and risks of human exposure,\" Australian chief veterinary officer Dr Mark Schipp said.\r\n\r\nFederal, state and territory authorities are meeting regularly to \"work through the next steps of this situation\".\r\n\r\nAnyone who works with pigs or horses, even if they're back yard pets, is urged to keep an eye out and report any possible signs of the disease.\r\n\r\nAustralia's acting chief medical officer, Sonya Bennett, said 2 vaccinations were available for protection against JEV in Australia.\r\n\r\nOlder people and those aged under 5 who are infected have a higher risk of developing a serious illness.\r\n\r\n\"Encephalitis is the most serious clinical consequence of JEV infection. Illness usually begins with symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, headache and vomiting,\" she said. Bennett said anyone experiencing these symptoms should seek urgent medical attention.\r\n\r\nShe encouraged people to avoid exposure to infected mosquitoes, with those in high mosquito areas encouraged to use repellent and cover up with loose-fitting clothing.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] Pigs, people and climate\r\nDate: Thu 3 Mar 2022\r\nSource: The Sydney Morning Herald [edited]\r\n<https://www.smh.com.au/national/three-in-hospital-amid-fears-of-japanese-encephalitis-spreading-from-pigs-to-people-20220302-p5a0wp.html>\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 3 Victorians in hospital with suspected cases of Japanese encephalitis after health authorities discovered a massive outbreak at pig farms across Australia's south-east that had gone undetected for weeks.\r\n\r\nJapanese encephalitis is generally harmless but in the fewer than 1% of cases where symptoms do develop, one patient in 3 will die. A vaccine is available, but there is no treatment.\r\n\r\nGlobally, the mosquito-borne virus, which spreads between waterbirds, pigs and humans, kills about 17 000 people a year, but it has never been seen south of Cape York. Experts say the deadly disease was brought here by the warming climate and is now here to stay.\r\n\r\n\"We never expected to see it in southern regions of Australia. This has taken a lot of us by surprise,\" said Associate Professor Cameron Webb, an expert in the virus, based at the University of Sydney.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected arrival of the disease explains why, when several pig farms reported a mysterious and concerning rise in piglet stillbirths, it took authorities several weeks to even consider testing for Japanese encephalitis.\r\n\r\nWhen they got the results back on Friday [25 Feb 2022], they discovered an enormous outbreak. Biological sampling revealed the virus at 9 piggeries, which stretch more than 1000 kilometres from Goondiwindi in south-east Queensland all the way down to Lockington in Victoria's north.\r\n\r\nPiggeries with confirmed infections of Japanese encephalitis [A map of the locations is accessible at the above URL]\r\n\r\nAustralia's Chief Veterinary Officer, Mark Schipp, said those piggeries housed about 150 000 pigs. There are probably twice that number of feral pigs living nearby, so \"we are unlikely to be able to eradicate the virus\", Dr Schipp said. Another 5 piggeries are under investigation.\r\n\r\nVictorian health authorities issued a warning on Saturday [26 Feb 2022] following the discovery of the virus at the piggeries. At that point, there were no confirmed cases in humans. Since then, 4 human cases have been identified in Victoria, with 3 people now in hospital.\r\n\r\nOther types of virus that cause encephalitis in Australia include Murray Valley encephalitis and West Nile virus.\r\n\r\nHealth authorities are also aware of several encephalitis cases of unknown cause across NSW, Victoria and South Australia over the past month. Japanese encaphalitis is not habitually tested for because, until now, no one thought it was here. The NSW and South Australian health departments said on Wednesday [2 Mar 2022] that they did not have any confirmed cases.\r\n\r\nFewer than 1% of people who are infected develop clinical illness, but in those who do, the virus can be deadly as it moves into the spinal cord and brain. Children face extra risks and are often left with significant brain injuries.\r\n\r\n\"It's pretty dangerous. You don't want to get it,\" said Scott Ritchie, an adjunct professor at James Cook University, who has published several papers on the virus.\r\n\r\n\"It can kill you, or it can induce long-term neurological effects. You might be in a coma, paralysis. It is a nasty disease.\"\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday [2 Mar 2022], Victoria's Health Department said it did not have any detail of the condition of the 3 people in hospital.\r\n\r\nIn a statement issued on Saturday [26 Feb 2022], Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton warned Victorians of the dangers of the virus.\r\n\r\n\"Most people will have no, or very mild, symptoms, but anyone who develops a sudden onset of fever, headache and vomiting should see their doctor immediately,\" Professor Sutton said.\r\n\r\n\"People with these symptoms can deteriorate over just a few short days, including suffering a loss of co-ordination, disorientation, generalised weakness and, in some cases, issues with movement which can last for years.\"\r\n\r\nJapanese encephalitis is spread by infected mosquitoes and waterbirds, which pass the virus between each other. The problem comes when mosquitos carry the virus into pigs, who can generate extremely high viral loads. Mosquitos can then carry the virus from pig to human. It cannot be spread from human to human.\r\n\r\nThis is how much of the country had record or very much above average rainfall over summer [A map showing rainfall amounts in Australia 1 Dec 2021-28 Feb 2022 at the source URL]\r\n\r\nHealth authorities are considering rolling out the vaccine to pig workers.\r\n\r\nTim Kingma, the president of the Victorian Farmers Federation's Pig Group told the ABC he wasn't particularly worried about the virus. \"It was a bit daunting on the morning to hear about it. Our 1st thoughts go to the people we employ, our communities, our kids,\" he said. \"In terms of worry, there are a lot worse exotic diseases out there. This one has no effect on meat. The issue purely is a mosquito can transfer this from a pig to a human.\"\r\n\r\nExactly how the virus came to infect pigs across eastern Australia is unclear, and might never be known for certain.\r\n\r\nThe virus has been genomically linked to fatal cases in the Tiwi Islands in March 2021 and Papua New Guinea. That suggests it was carried to the Australian mainland by migrating waterbirds -- or mosquitoes blown by monsoon rains.\r\n\r\nThe virus probably landed before La Nina's huge summer rains created a \"conveyer belt\" for infected waterbirds and mosquitoes to head south, said Professor Webb. Murray Valley encephalitis tends to move in much the same way, he said.\r\n\r\nProfessor Webb said the climate crisis \"certainly plays a role\" in the spread of the virus by increasing the likelihood of extreme rainfall.\r\n\r\nOngoing rain and flooding means conditions will be perfect for the virus for several months, but as they recede the risk is likely to fall, though infected mosquito eggs can survive for years, hatching again in the next La Nina season.\r\n\r\nAuthorities will try to control the virus by cutting mosquito numbers in infected areas, and limiting the movement of pigs. A pig cull is off the table as there are too many feral animals -- and too many waterbirds.\r\n\r\nThe federal health department is asking people who live in areas of eastern Australia with large numbers of mosquitoes to take steps to avoid being bitten by wearing long clothing and using mosquito repellent.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Liam Mannix]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[A 3 Mar 2022 report from HealthMap Alerts in the Brisbane Times stated, \"JEV is spread through an opportunistic mosquito called _Culex annulirostris_, which feeds on a range of animals, including birds, pigs and humans. Associate Professor Greg Devine, the head of QIMR Berghofer's Mosquito Control Laboratory, said the recent wet weather caused by the La Nina weather system was likely to blame for the spread of the disease through Queensland.\r\n\r\n\"There is precedent -- in the past a similar virus, Murray Valley encephalitis, saw widespread outbreaks in 1974 and 2011,\" he said. \"Obviously there were big floods in those years, but it's not the floods themselves, the floods and the virus are both symptoms of the fact that those years saw months of very wet conditions, which is conducive to mosquitoes spreading the virus.\" (<https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/qld-floods-raise-japanese-encephalitis-risk-with-cases-suspected-in-victoria-20220303-p5a1aw.html>)] \r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] Human case, Queensland\r\nDate: Thu 3 Mar 2022\r\nSource: Queensland Government, Queensland Health [edited]\r\n<https://www.health.qld.gov.au/news-events/doh-media-releases/releases/public-health-alert-confirmed-human-case-of-japanese-encephalitis-virus2>\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Health Alert - Confirmed human case of Japanese encephalitis virus\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA public health alert is being issued following a confirmed human case of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in Queensland.\r\n\r\nThe confirmed case had recent travel in regional southern Queensland and is currently being treated in a Brisbane hospital.\r\n\r\nJEV is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito to people and animals. In animals, it mostly occurs in pigs and horses.\r\n\r\nClinicians at Queensland hospitals have been asked to be alert to the possibility of JEV in people presenting with encephalitis or a similar illness.\r\n\r\nMost human infections of JEV cause no symptoms or mild symptoms such as headache or fever. A person with severe disease may present with inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), characterised by sudden onset of vomiting, high fever and chills, severe headache, sensitivity to light, neck stiffness and nausea/vomiting.\r\n\r\nChildren aged under 5 years and older people who are infected with JEV are at a higher risk of developing more severe illness.\r\n\r\nWe encourage Queenslanders to take necessary steps to prevent being bitten by mosquitoes, especially given the recent flooding event which may lead to an increase in mosquito numbers in coming weeks.\r\n\r\nMeasures to prevent mosquito bites include regularly applying insect repellent containing Diethyl Toluamide (DEET), Picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus; wearing loose, light-coloured clothing to cover up arms, legs and feet; and using other insecticide-based mosquito control devices where possible when outside.\r\n\r\nMosquito bites can be experienced at any time of day, but some species are most active at dusk and dawn.\r\n\r\nAround your home, it's important to inspect for common mosquito breeding sites, clean up debris and make sure to empty, wipe out and store any outdoor containers in a dry place.\r\n\r\nIt's also important to ensure flyscreens are in good order so mosquitoes can't enter your home easily.\r\n\r\nJapanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a nationally notifiable disease in both humans and animals.\r\n\r\nThe human case follows a detection at a piggery in southern Queensland last week. There have also been detections in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.\r\n\r\nThere is no risk to humans from consuming pork or pig products. Pork products are safe to eat.\r\n\r\nThe virus cannot be spread directly from person to person.\r\n\r\nQueensland Health is working collaboratively with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and industry, as well as state, territory and national counterparts to discuss a national response. Support is also being provided to intensive livestock industry workers.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nIrene Lai\r\nInternational SOS\r\n<Irene.lai@internationalsos.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Irene Lai for submitting the official report in item 3 above.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the presence of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus in mainland Australia and the response to it is an excellent example of a comprehensive, one health approach to a new emerging disease situation. Pig farmers in several localities recognized that something was wrong with their animals. Their veterinarians collected appropriate samples from the pigs. Timely laboratory support identified JE virus in those samples. The presence of wild, feral pigs was taken into account in the decision not to cull affected domestic piggeries. Knowing that JE is a zoonotic disease, public health authorities issued an alert to health care providers. Human cases were quickly diagnosed. Vaccination of humans was made available. The environmental conditions favoring proliferation of vector mosquito populations, ample rainfall and flooding, was assessed. The occurrence of JE virus transmission over a wide geographic area raises the question of whether the virus now has become established in mainland Australia in areas where it has not been detected before. Doubtless, intensified, ongoing surveillance for human and pig disease and for presence of the virus in vector mosquitoes will be ongoing in eastern and southern Australia. - Mod.TY\n\nProMED map:\nAustralia: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701785,186>]\n\n[See Also:\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (02): (QL, NS, VI) pig, OIE 20220304.8701778\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia. alert 20220228.8701705\r\n2001\r\n----\r\nJapanese enceph. virus - Australia: nat. barriers (02) 20010201.0218\r\nJapanese enceph. virus - Australia: natural barriers 20010115.0118\r\n200\r\n----\r\n10 Jul 2000 Japanese encephalitis virus, mosquitoes - Australia 20000710.1143\r\n1998\r\n----\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia 19980402.0604\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (02) 19980509.0922\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (03) 19981201.2311\r\n1996\r\n----\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Torres Strait, Australia 19960423.0777\r\n1995\r\n----\r\nJE - Australia 19950523.0337\r\nJE - Australia (credit) 19950525.0340\r\nJE - Australia (first record) 19950427.0229]\n.................................................sb/mpp/ty/may/mpp"

Monkeypox occurs throughout Central and West Africa, often near tropical rain forests.\r\n\r\nPeople become infected with the monkeypox virus through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or humans (alive or dead), including respiratory droplets, or through contact with materials contaminated with the virus.\r\n\r\nSymptoms include fever (\u2265 100.4 deg F [38.6 deg C]), headache, muscle aches, and swollen lymph nodes, followed by a rash. Patients are usually ill for 2-4 weeks. Monkeypox is fatal in as many as 1 to 10% of people who become infected. Prior vaccination against smallpox may provide protection against monkeypox.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n\n[As noted in the comment in a previous ProMED post (Monkeypox - Africa (01): Nigeria 20220112.8700812), monkeypox virus continues to be transmitted to people in Nigeria. The sporadic monkeypox (MPX) cases have been widely distributed in Nigeria. In 2019, cases occurred in 9 states. From September 2017 to November 2019, with 9 deaths in 183 cases, the CFR (case fatality rate) was 5%. Nigeria has been a source of MPX cases that have been imported into other countries, most recently into the UK (see Monkeypox - UK: ex Nigeria 20191206.6827532) and Singapore (see Monkeypox - Singapore ex Nigeria 20190511.6464598).\r\n\r\nThere is no mention in the above report how many of the MPX cases were acquired from wildlife hosts or how many were due to contact with infected people. Prevention of MPX virus infections will not be possible without knowing the source of infection and locality where they occurred. The question remains about the source of these recent infections. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. A vaccine that is expected to be effective against MPX has been developed recently, but deciding where to mount a campaign in this broad geographic area would be a challenge.\r\n\r\nThe MPX virus clade involved in these and previous cases is not mentioned. As noted in previous ProMED posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans -- with a case fatality rate of 10-17% -- than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. The reported case fatality rate in Nigeria is comparatively low. - Mod.TY\n\nProMED map:\nNigeria: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701807,62>]\n\n[See Also:\nMonkeypox - Africa (01): Nigeria 20220112.8700812\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nMonkeypox - USA (03): (MD) ex Nigeria 20211119.8699741\r\nMonkeypox - USA (02): (TX) ex Nigeria 20210723.8538949\r\nMonkeypox - USA: (TX) ex Nigeria 20210717.8524846\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (03): Nigeria 20200122.6904535\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (07): Nigeria 20191215.6841084\r\nMonkeypox - UK: ex Nigeria 20191206.6827532\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (05): Nigeria 20191027.6749479\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (04): Nigeria 20191018.6734679\r\nMonkeypox, smallpox vaccine 20190928.6699452\r\nMonkeypox - Singapore ex Nigeria 20190511.6464598\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (02): Nigeria 20190220.6327203]\n.................................................sb/mpp/ty/may/mpp"

While signs of disease may not be noticeable in some infected animals, in some cases it can kill the animal.\r\n\r\nIn an update issued last week, Australia's chief veterinary officer Dr Mark Schipp warned LSD poses serious trade impacts across the live animal trade, and for exporters of dairy products, genetic materials, hides and some meat products.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the infection was transmitted across the Malacca straits from Malaysia. The straits are only 65 km [40.4 mi] wide at their narrowest point.\r\n\r\nIt now appears likely that the virus will spread through the rest of the Indonesian archipelago to the south and east.\r\n\r\nOnce LSD reaches the eastern island of Timor, Australia will be the next country under threat.\r\n\r\nLumpy skin disease (LSD) is primarily transmitted by biting insects including flies and mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nTransmission is also possible through direct contact.\r\n\r\nLSD virus is very resistant and can survive in favourable environmental conditions for many months. It is transportable on equipment including footwear.\r\n\r\nThe disease originated in southern Africa but since the 1970s has extended north and east through the Middle East then Turkey, Russia and China.\r\n\r\nSince 2019 it has been spreading through Asia including India, Taiwan and Vietnam.\r\n\r\nIn 2021 it was reported in Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and most recently in peninsular Malaysia.\r\n\r\nGiven the history of transmission to date, there is a real possibility that Australia will become infected with this very serious bovine disease with marginal vaccines as our only protection.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 main reasons this disease presents an extremely serious threat to the Australian cattle industry.\r\n\r\nFirstly, transmission by insects means that conventional quarantine, border controls and biosecurity are largely ineffective. With the island of Timor only 800 km [497 mi] from the Australian mainland, it is feasible that infected insects could travel across the ocean on the Northeast monsoon.\r\n\r\nIf the disease enters Australia, it is likely to infect the northern tropics where 100% cattle control is not possible so even if a vaccine is available, some animals will miss out during routine musters allowing the disease to continue to circulate in the unvaccinated stock. The large herd of wild buffalo in the Northern Territory also represents a serious potential reservoir of infection.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the only vaccines available are far from ideal. All of the useful vaccines contain live attenuated virus. I have spoken to a dairy vet in Thailand last week who advised that while unexposed dairy cattle respond well to the vaccine with negligible side effects, dairy herds which have already been exposed to natural infection show a low level of clinical signs such as fever and skin lumps following vaccination. Despite these concerns about vaccination, Thai dairy farmers have generally decided to use the available vaccine because natural infection in unvaccinated cattle has been producing severe signs and economic loss in 30 to 40% of animals in the herd including fever, weight loss, reduced milk production, reduced conception rates, some abortions, secondary infections, and mortalities in calves. Once the herds have been vaccinated the focus of the disease is on calves. I have also had advice that when the vaccine was used in large dairy herds in China there were negligible clinical signs.\r\n\r\nThe impact on the dairy industry is likely to be greatest as infection results in a significant reduction in milk production which usually lasts for the remainder of the lactation period.\r\n\r\nThe distance between Timor and Australia is about 800 km [497 mi]. During the Northeast monsoon, prevailing winds blow from the north and west across Indonesia towards the top end of Australia.\r\n\r\nWith only Java and the eastern islands of Indonesia standing between the Sumatran outbreak and a serious threat to Northern Australia, the Australian government will no doubt be providing every assistance possible to Indonesia to help it arrest the transmission of the virus. Indonesia has only a small but valuable cattle and buffalo herd (official statistics say 17 million head) which is likely to be devastated if the virus is not prevented from spreading throughout the archipelago.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this disease represents the most serious threat to the Australian cattle industry that I have seen since leaving veterinary school in 1975.\r\n\r\nApart from the usual biosecurity protocols, one thing that the Australian government and industry could do to protect our cattle herd from potential disaster is to harness the latest vaccine technologies that have been developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to very quickly produce a new and highly effective vaccine in time to stop LSD in its tracks.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Dr Ross Ainsworth]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for his submission.\r\n\r\nLSD has spread since 2019 into the following Asian/South-East Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, China, Bhutan, Nepal, Viet Nam, Taiwan, Myanmar, China (Hong Kong SAR), Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Lao's People Democratic Republic and Mongolia.

In its monthly communiqu\u00e9, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said the girl first went for a check-up in December [2021] after having 2 seizures at home.\r\n\r\nThe NICD said: \"On examination, she was febrile (38.4\u00b0C [101.1\u00b0F]) and had mild dehydration, with the rest of the examination being normal. She was admitted to Red Cross Hospital for a CT brain scan, which was normal. Blood work was congruent with the clinical picture of mild dehydration. She was discharged on 28 Dec 2021.\"\r\n\r\nBut, about 2 weeks later, she went to the hospital again for diarrhoea and vomiting. Her temperature was 39.8\u00b0C [103.6\u00b0F], and she was discharged after being given oral rehydration therapy.\r\n\r\nThree days later, she was back at the hospital with ongoing vomiting and fever. They performed an electroencephalogram (EEG) on her to check if she might have epilepsy. Her blood work, the NICD said, showed anaemia, thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count), and the presence of malaria parasites, with a subsequent diagnosis of cerebral malaria.\r\n\r\n\"She commenced IV artesunate and recovered fully. As she had no recent history of travel to a malaria-endemic area, her illness was termed odyssean malaria.\"\r\n\r\nThe NICD said a full environmental investigation was done to try and figure out how she got the disease. It said: \"No vector source was found at the patient's usual places of residence, and the only potential link to a source was a neighbour who was confirmed to have travelled from Mozambique in the last week of December [2021]. Thankfully, no additional malaria cases were diagnosed in the area.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the NICD, odyssean malaria is also known as airport, suitcase, minibus, or taxi-rank malaria. It is likely that a malaria vector mosquito, accidentally transported from a malaria area, was responsible.\r\n\r\nThis is not the 1st time someone with no history of travel has been infected with malaria. In 2017, 4 cases of malaria were reported in Kilner Park, Pretoria, affecting people with no recent history of travel. At the time, the NICD said that between 2007 and 2017, over 69 cases of odyssean malaria had been reported in the country, mostly in Gauteng.\r\n\r\nThe NICD said as a precautionary measure, healthcare facilities in the district were advised to be suspicious of malaria in individuals presenting with \"flu-like illnesses.\"\r\n\r\n\"This presentation of delayed diagnosis of malaria, as well as complicated malaria, is typical in odyssean malaria cases. Healthcare workers should check for malaria in patients with recurrent unexplained pyrexia even with no history of travel, to prevent delayed diagnosis and subsequent complications.\"\r\n\r\n[Byline: Tebogo Monama]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Such cases are rare but not unknown. If the climate is suitable and the local _Anopheles_ mosquitoes are able to transmit malaria, it may be an infection from a person with a recent travel history to a malaria-endemic country; as in this case, Mozambique.\r\n\r\nOther cases are more obscure like the case ProMED recently reported from Spain (see below) and a case from Italy where genetic analysis found the same strain of _P. falciparum_ in an Italian girl and a patient from Burkina Faso admitted to the same hospital. The route of transmission was never established. An analysis from the ECDC in 2018 listed 6 cases, mostly transfusion related. - Mod.EP\n\nProMED map:\nWestern Cape Province, South Africa: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701819,4335>]\n\n[See Also:\nMalaria, P. falciparum - Spain: (AN) RFI 20220215.8701477\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nMalaria - Europe: hospital-acquired 2016-2018 20180430.5775615\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nMalaria - Italy (04): fatal case, genetic analysis 20171104.5424421]\n.................................................sb/ep/mpp/rd/mpp"

The Ministry of Health says 3 patients have already died from the disease in Isiolo County.\r\n\r\nActing Director-General for Health Patrick Amoth said in total, 15 people are suspected to have the disease, but only 3 cases have been confirmed. The confirmed cases are in Merti and Garbatulla sub-counties of Isiolo.\r\n\r\n\"The 1st case was detected on 12 Jan 2022. To date, 15 patients presenting with fever, jaundice, muscle pain and joint pain have been line-listed, the youngest being 11 years and the oldest being 65 years,\" Amoth said in a letter to health CECs across the country on Friday [4 Mar 2022]. The majority of the sick are young male adults.\r\n\r\nHowever, the ministry will likely face criticism because although the 1st case was reported on 12 Jan [2022], no alert was issued.\r\n\r\n\"Sadly, we have recorded 3 deaths so far. Out of the 6 samples analysed at KEMRI [Kenya Medical Research Institute], 3 turned positive through serology (immunoglobulin M) and PCR,\" Amoth said.\r\n\r\nHe put the entire country on alert but said the high-risk counties of Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit, Meru, Samburu, Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot, and Turkana should be more watchful. He said the national government and partners are already mobilising resources to support response activities including vaccination.\r\n\r\n\"The ministry plans to conduct yellow fever vaccination in Isiolo and other high-risk counties, including Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit, Meru, Samburu, Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot, Turkana, and possibly Tana River and Mandera,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe ministry will also deploy a rapid response team to Isiolo and neighboring counties to establish the magnitude and extent of the outbreak, determine at-risk populations, conduct a risk assessment, initiate risk communication and community engagement activities, and implement integrated vector control measures.\r\n\r\nThe last indigenous cases of yellow fever reported in Kenya occurred from mid-1992 through March 1993 in the south Kerio Valley.\r\n\r\nThe WHO continues to place Kenya on its watchlist because of the extremely low yellow fever vaccination rate. The jab, offered once in a lifetime, is sold at KES 2000 [USD 17.5] in limited places across the country.\r\n\r\nEstimates from WHO and UNICEF in 2020 on routine yellow fever vaccination coverage was 44% in the African region, much lower than the 80% threshold required to confer herd immunity against yellow fever.\r\n\r\nLast week, the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), told the Star that yellow fever could return because of the abundance of the mosquito varieties that transmit it.\r\n\r\nShillah Simiyu, an infectious disease scientist at ICIPE [International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology], said if they are infected with the virus, they will easily transmit the disease to many people.\r\n\r\n\"[Kenya] is also potentially at risk of yellow fever re-emergence given the recent recurrent yellow fever outbreaks in the neighbouring countries of Uganda, South Sudan, and Ethiopia with the possibility of cross-border spillover either through infected non-human primates, humans, or mosquitoes,\" she said.\r\n\r\nBetween February to June 2021, Shillah and her team collected 3865 mosquitoes belonging to 37 different mosquito species in Nguruman (Kajiado county) and 1973 in Kerio Valley (Baringo county).\r\n\r\n\"Yellow fever vectors accounted for 37.9% of Nguruman's mosquito collection,\" Shillah says. In Kerio Valley, the types of mosquitoes that spread yellow fever -- _Aedes aegypti_, _Aedes simpsoni_, and _Aedes vittatus_ -- were the most abundant with abundances of 42.3%, 16.6%, and 7.6%, respectively. _Aedes africanus_, which was implicated in Kenya's last outbreak in 1992, only accounted for 0.10% of the collection. \"Therefore, there is a need to intensify surveillance and vector control strategies in these areas,\" she said. She also presented her findings at the recently-ended Kemri annual scientific and health conference in Nairobi,\" she said.\r\n\r\nOnce contracted, the yellow fever virus incubates in the body for 3-6 days. Many people do not experience symptoms, but when these do occur, the most common are fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. In most cases, symptoms disappear after 3-4 days, Dr Amoth said.\r\n\r\n\"A small percentage of patients, however, enter a 2nd, more toxic phase within 24 hours of recovering from initial symptoms. High fever returns and several body systems are affected, usually the liver and the kidneys,\" he added. In this phase people are likely to develop jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes, hence the name \"yellow fever\"), dark urine and abdominal pain with vomiting. Bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach. Half of the patients who enter the toxic phase die within 7-10 days.\r\n\r\nHe said the disease is difficult to diagnose, especially during the early stages. A more severe case can be confused with severe malaria, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis (especially fulminant forms), other haemorrhagic fevers, infection with other flaviviruses (such as dengue haemorrhagic fever), and poisoning.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no specific anti-viral drug for yellow fever, but specific care to treat dehydration, liver and kidney failure, and fever improves outcomes. Associated bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics.\r\n\r\n[Byline: John Muchangi]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\nand\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[Kenya has experienced cases of yellow fever (YF) infrequently. The low vaccination rate is of concern. One hopes that the rapid response will lead to a prompt vaccination campaign in the affected areas. A YF vaccine shortage was reported in 2020 (see Yellow fever - Africa (04): Kenya vaccine shortage 20200130.6935353). Apparently that shortage has ended.\r\n\r\nThe previous outbreak was in 1991-1993 (see references below). During that outbreak, a report indicated that nearly all confirmed infections were acquired between 1500 and 1800 m (4900-5900 ft) in the Tugen Hills (Baringo district, Rift Valley province). Transmission appeared to be entirely sylvatic, that is, all confirmed cases were independent of other human cases and had acquired their infection by contact with mosquitoes that had been infected by feeding on viraemic monkeys. Infected mosquitoes (_Aedes africanus_ and _Ae. keniensis_) were captured close to a cluster of human cases at about 1700 m (5577 ft) (see Yellow fever - Africa (17): Kenya, background 20110504.1377). Although the mosquito vectors in the current outbreak have not been reported, the mosquito surveys done in the 2 counties reported above, although distant from the current outbreak, do indicate that that vector mosquitoes capable of urban transmission are present in Kenya.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------\r\n1.

The declaration was made under the Emergency Response Plan for Communicable Disease Incidents of National Significance, in consultation with the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.\r\n\r\nDr Bennett's declaration followed her giving the National Security Committee of Cabinet a briefing earlier this week on the unfolding situation regarding JEV. \"I have declared the JEV situation a Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance after determining a national approach is required in relation to coordination of health policy, interventions and public messaging,\" Dr Bennett said.\r\n\r\n\"A national working group of communicable disease, vaccine and arbovirus experts has been established to support the response, including mosquito surveillance and control measures and identification of those at direct risk, and for the rollout of vaccines. Public health communications regarding mosquito protection will target affected communities. The Australian Government's health and agriculture departments are working very closely with their state government counterparts to ensure a swift and coordinated response.\"\r\n\r\nOn Thursday evening [3 Mar 2022], Queensland officials confirmed a human case of JEV in that state. The case had recently travelled in regional parts of the state's south and is being treated in a Brisbane hospital. The Department of Health is aware of other cases, in multiple states, of encephalitis of unknown origin that are being investigated for arboviral diseases, including JEV.\r\n\r\nThe Australian Government will work closely with states and territories to educate the community about JEV, what precautions people should take, and symptoms to be aware of. The Government will also work closely with the states and territories to support the distribution of vaccine doses to at-risk population groups.\r\n\r\nJEV is a mosquito-borne viral disease that mostly occurs in pigs and horses, but can cause disease in people and rarely other animals. Pigs are the focus from a human health perspective, as they can infect mosquitoes that can then infect humans. This is not the case with horses.\r\n\r\nHumans can become infected with JEV through the bite of an infected mosquito. The virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and it cannot be caught through eating pork or pig products.\r\n\r\nLess than 1% of people infected may develop a serious illness such as encephalitis and experience symptoms including neck stiffness, severe headache and coma, and, more rarely, permanent neurological complications or death. The vast majority of infected people will show mild or no symptoms at all.\r\n\r\nAustralia's Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Mark Schipp, said JEV had been confirmed at 14 piggeries across NSW, SA, Queensland and Victoria. \"The key signs to look out for in pigs are stillborn or weak piglets, some with an impaired nervous system. Piglets can develop encephalitis or wasting, depression or hindlimb paralysis. Adult sows do not typically show signs of disease,\" Dr Schipp said.\r\n\r\n\"In horses, many cases show no signs of the disease. Some animals may show signs of elevated temperature, jaundice, lethargy or anorexia. Other signs may include lack of coordination, difficulty swallowing, impaired vision or over-excitement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pig producers are asked to be highly vigilant for signs of this disease and report unexplained pig abortions or stillbirths. People working with pigs, even if they're only a backyard pet or a small herd, should take steps to control mosquitoes, as well as continuing to practice good biosecurity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horse owners can also put measures in place to help their horses avoid mosquito bites, including using hooded rugs, fly masks, and applying a safe insect repellent.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you suspect an animal is showing signs of the disease, you must report it via your local veterinarian or the national Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888.\"\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[The occurrence of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus infections in pigs and people in mainland Australia has been of significant concern at the national level so that the Australian Acting Chief Medical Officer has declared it a Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance in consultation with the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. The formation of an interdisciplinary working group and collaboration at the state and territory officials is a timely response. Given the recent rains and flooding in eastern and southern regions in Australia leading to increased populations of vector mosquitoes and the geographically widespread occurrence of JE cases, controlling transmission of the virus will be a challenge. Enlisting public cooperation in case reporting will be very helpful in the surveillance effort. - Mod.TY\n\nProMED map:\nAustralia: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701811,186>]\n\n[See Also:\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (03): (VI, QL) spread 20220305.8701785\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (02): (QL, NS, VI) pig, OIE 20220304.8701778\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia: alert 20220228.8701705\r\n2001\r\n----\r\nJapanese enceph. virus - Australia: nat. barriers (02) 20010201.0218\r\nJapanese enceph. virus - Australia: natural barriers 20010115.0118\r\n2000\r\n----\r\nJapanese encephalitis virus, mosquitoes - Australia 20000710.1143\r\n1998\r\n----\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (03) 19981201.2311\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (02) 19980509.0922\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia 19980402.0604\r\n1996\r\n----\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Torres Strait, Australia 19960423.0777\r\n1995\r\n----\r\nJE - Australia 19950523.0337\r\nJE - Australia (credit) 19950525.0340\r\nJE - Australia (first record) 19950427.0229]\n.................................................ty/rd/mpp"

Kala-azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis or black fever, is transmitted through the bite of an infected female phlebotomine sandfly, which in the past would not survive in areas above 650 metres [2133 ft]. Detection of kala-azar cases in unfamiliar places like Kalikot, where the elevation ranges from 738 metres [2421 ft] to above 4000 metres [13 123 ft], indicates that phlebotomine sandflies are moving up mountains because the earth is warming.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, cases of vector-borne diseases such as kala-azar and dengue have been reported from districts like Mugu, Humla, Jajarkot, Jumla and Salyan, which are considered colder places.\r\n\r\nA recent report of the United Nations \"Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability\" states that at least 6 major vector-borne diseases affected by the climate drivers have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.\r\n\r\nThe report also shows increasing evidence that climate warming has extended the elevational distribution of _Anopheles_, _Culex_ and _Aedes_ mosquito vectors above 2000 metres [6561 ft] in Nepal. Of about 460 species of _Anopheles_, over 100 transmit malaria. Over 950 species of _Aedes_ spread dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever and West Nile virus. Over 1000 species of _Culex_ transmit Japanese encephalitis, filariasis and West Nile virus.\r\n\r\n\"Host animals in novel areas may be immunologically naive, therefore more vulnerable to severe illness,\" the report states.\r\n\r\nVector-borne diseases (VBDs) are spread by carriers like mosquitoes, sandflies, kissing bugs and ticks. The report says that viruses like dengue, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis are emerging in Nepal in hilly and mountainous areas. \"The emergence of VBDs in the areas which were considered non-endemic in the past can pose a major public health challenge for Nepal,\" said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Arjun Poudel]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[It is well known from malaria, another vector-borne disease, that it can be transmitted at a higher altitude with a warmer climate.

The study, published in Nature Medicine by researchers at the Veterans Affairs (VA) St Louis Health Care System, found that in the year after recovering from the illness's acute phase, patients had increased risks of an array of cardiovascular problems, including abnormal heart rhythms, heart muscle inflammation, blood clots, strokes, myocardial infarction, and heart failure (<https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01689-3>). What's more, the heightened risks were evident even among those who weren't hospitalized with acute COVID-19.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, the research team resolved to identify and address important knowledge gaps around COVID-19, study senior author Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, told JAMA in an email. \"At that time, none of us knew anything about long COVID,\" noted Al-Aly, who is chief of research and development at the VA St Louis Health Care System and a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St Louis. \"Over several weeks, we started hearing about patients who were not fully recovering and had lingering issues including heart problems.\" These patients -- who call themselves long haulers -- inspired the team to study long COVID, also known as post-COVID conditions.\r\n\r\nIn a report published in Nature last April [2021], the researchers demonstrated that people with long COVID can have sequelae in several organ systems, including cardiovascular disorders (<https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03553-9>). With the current study, they set out to gain a deeper understanding of COVID-19's long-term cardiovascular consequences.\r\n\r\nThe new analysis in Nature Medicine examined a comprehensive, prespecified set of cardiovascular outcomes among patients in the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system who survived the first 30 days of COVID-19. The researchers estimated the risks and excess burden of cardiovascular outcomes per 1000 persons 12 months after COVID-19 using electronic medical record data from 3 large cohorts:\r\n\r\n- 153 760 patients who used VHA services in 2019 and had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result between 1 Mar 2020 and 15 Jan 2021\r\n- 5 637 647 patients with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection who used VHA services in 2019 -- the contemporary control group\r\n- 5 859 411 prepandemic patients who used VHA services in 2017 -- the historical control group\r\n\r\nThe cohorts largely comprised older White male patients. The COVID-19 cohort, which averaged 61 years old, included 89% males and about 71% White individuals. But because the study was large, it also included almost 17 000 female patients; about 37 000 Black patients; and almost 8000 Latino, Asian, American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and patients of other races with COVID-19.\r\n\r\nPatients with COVID-19 were at increased risk of a broad range of cardiovascular disorders, including cerebrovascular disorders, dysrhythmias, ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease, pericarditis, myocarditis, heart failure, and thromboembolic disease.\r\n\r\nAt the 12-month mark, compared with the contemporary control group, for every 1000 people, COVID-19 was associated with an extra:\r\n\r\n- 45.29 incidents of any prespecified cardiovascular outcome\r\n- 23.48 incidents of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality\r\n- 19.86 incidents of dysrhythmias, including 10.74 incidents of atrial fibrillation\r\n- 12.72 incidents of other cardiovascular disorders including 11.61 incidents of heart failure and 3.56 incidents of nonischemic cardiomyopathy\r\n- 9.88 incidents of thromboembolic disorders, including 5.47 incidents of pulmonary embolism and 4.18 incidents of deep vein thrombosis\r\n- 7.28 incidents of ischemic heart disease, including 5.35 incidents of acute coronary disease, 2.91 incidents of myocardial infarction, and 2.5 incidents of angina\r\n- 5.48 incidents of cerebrovascular disorders, including 4.03 incidents of stroke\r\n- 1.23 incidents of inflammatory disease of the heart or pericardium, including 0.98 incidents of pericarditis and 0.31 incidents of myocarditis\r\n\r\nPatients with more severe disease -- determined by whether they recuperated at home, were hospitalized, or were admitted to the intensive care unit -- had higher risks. But the risks were evident even among those who were not hospitalized with COVID-19. Other subgroup analysis found increased risks regardless of age, race, sex, obesity, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hyperlipidemia, and preexisting cardiovascular disease.\r\n\r\nThe study's overall findings were consistent when outcomes were compared between patients with COVID-19 and the control group of prepandemic patients.\r\n\r\n\"In our work, we show serious long-term cardiovascular disease consequences of COVID-19,\" Al-Aly wrote. \"Most of these are lifelong conditions that will affect people for a lifetime and may impact their quality of life and other health outcomes. The risks reported in our paper may appear small but given the large number of people with COVID-19 in the United States and globally, these numbers will likely translate into millions of people with heart disease in the United States and many more around the world. We need to realize this now and make sure we are prepared and ready to address the needs of these patients.\"\r\n\r\n[Byline: Jennifer Abbasi]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nClaudinne Miller\r\nTulane Outbreak News\r\n<cmiller15@tulane.edu>\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] New Zealand\r\nDate: Thu 3 Mar 2022\r\nSource: The New York Times [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/world/australia/new-zealand-covid-omicron.html>\r\n\r\n\r\nFor much of the past 2 years, COVID-19 was a phantom presence in New Zealand, a plague experienced mostly through news reports from faraway lands. Now, suddenly, it has become a highly personal threat.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand is being walloped by a major outbreak of the omicron variant, with the virus spreading at what may be the fastest rate in the world. On Thursday [3 Mar 2022], the country reported 23 194 new cases, a once unthinkable number in a small island nation of about 5 million people where the record daily case count before the current wave was in the low hundreds.\r\n\r\nThe explosion in cases has come as the government, under political pressure, loosened its strict regulations meant to prevent the spread of the virus, and as the highly transmissible omicron reduced the effectiveness of the controls that remained. That has filled many New Zealanders with anxiety as they learn to live with the pandemic-related risk that the rest of the world has grappled with since early 2020.\r\n\r\n\"For the vast majority of the pandemic, most New Zealanders didn't know anyone who had COVID-19. That's changing massively now,\" said Siouxsie Wiles, a microbiologist at the University of Auckland. \"This is the 1st time most New Zealanders are dealing with COVID-19 in their own homes.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the ever-growing case numbers may be unsettling, New Zealand was perhaps as well positioned as it could have been for its deferred reckoning with the virus. Earlier in the pandemic, before the population was widely vaccinated, the country kept infections and deaths very low through a stringent quarantine system for incoming travelers, lockdowns during outbreaks and significant isolation periods for those who tested positive or were close contacts. Caseloads often stood at zero, and life for long periods resembled a time before the pandemic. Even after New Zealand began to shift away from a \"COVID zero\" strategy following the emergence of the delta variant, case numbers remained relatively small.\r\n\r\nBy the time of the arrival of the omicron variant -- which is more contagious but often produces milder symptoms -- the country was well protected. Ninety-five percent of New Zealanders over age 12 have been vaccinated, and 57% have had a booster shot. With this combination of strict measures and widespread inoculation, the country has reported just 56 virus deaths throughout the pandemic -- by far the lowest rate of any major democracy.\r\n\r\nBut New Zealand's initial caution toward the virus became politically untenable this year [2022] as citizens living overseas protested limits on their return and business advocates called for fewer restrictions. In response, the government weakened its pandemic controls. Last week, it removed many self-isolation requirements, and on Monday [28 Feb 2022] it announced that vaccinated New Zealanders could freely enter the country without isolating or quarantining. New Zealand remains closed to international tourists.\r\n\r\nWith the virus now spreading rapidly, the country has been forced to undergo a \"big psychological shift,\" said Michael Baker, an epidemiologist at the University of Otago in Dunedin. While the approach to managing the virus was once one of \"collective protection,\" Dr. Baker said, it is now one of \"much more individual and family responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nThe government has tried to prepare the public for this shift by warning that New Zealanders' experience of the virus would change. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern noted last week that \"very soon we will all know people who have COVID-19 or we will potentially get it ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nModelers estimate that each omicron-positive New Zealander is infecting an average of 4.64 other people -- the highest rate among 180 countries analyzed. Experts believe that half the country could be infected within 3 months.\r\n\r\nMajor outbreaks have also occurred in other countries, like Australia, that loosened strict pandemic measures. Australia's spike, however, occurred during the Southern Hemisphere summer, which Dr. Baker said significantly slowed the virus's spread.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand's outbreak, by contrast, has come as workplaces settled into the business year and students headed back to school and college. Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand's director-general of health, has called it a \"nationwide superspreader event.\"\r\n\r\nBy Tuesday [1 Mar 2022], there were over 3200 active cases of COVID-19 in Dunedin, with many hundreds more people self-isolating as household contacts. Students are anxious about the virus's spread and frustrated with the individual pressure they feel about managing it, Ms. Lama said.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in the country, anger over the government's COVID-19 response produced a different kind of superspreader event. In Wellington, the capital, hundreds of demonstrators opposed to vaccine mandates occupied the grounds surrounding Parliament in an occasionally violent protest that lasted for over 3 weeks. After serious clashes between the police and demonstrators, multiple officers began reporting COVID-19 infections. Partly because of the health risk, officers battled protesters to clear the occupation on Wednesday [2 Mar 2022].\r\n\r\n[Byline: Pete McKenzie]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nClaudinne Miller\r\nTulane Outbreak News\r\n<cmiller15@tulane.edu>\r\n\r\n[It is not surprising that there is an outbreak in New Zealand with the lifting of restrictions that were in place earlier in the pandemic, such as stringent quarantine system for incoming travelers, lockdowns during outbreaks and significant isolation periods for those who tested positive or were close contacts.

The virus has infected an average of 4.64 contacts there -- the highest rate among 180 countries analyzed. - Mod.LK]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] Qatar: infectiousness of variants\r\nDate: Thu 4 Mar 2022\r\nSource: MedRxiv [edited]\r\n<https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.02.22271771v1>\r\n\r\n\r\nRef: Suelen H.

We investigated effects of omicron subvariant (BA.1 and BA.2), previous vaccination, and prior infection on infectiousness of omicron infections, between 23 Dec 2021 and 20 Feb 2022. \r\n\r\nMethods: Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to estimate the association between the RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) value of PCR tests (a proxy for SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness) and each of the omicron subvariants, mRNA vaccination, prior infection, reason for RT-qPCR testing, calendar week of RT-qPCR testing (to account for phases of the rapidly evolving omicron wave), and demographic factors. \r\n\r\nResults: Compared to BA.1, BA.2 was associated with 3.53 fewer cycles (95% CI: 3.46-3.60), signifying higher infectiousness. Ct value decreased with time since 2nd and 3rd vaccinations. Ct values were highest for those who received their boosters in the month preceding the RT-qPCR test -- 0.86 cycles (95% CI: 0.72-1.00) higher than for unvaccinated persons. Ct value was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.20-1.39) cycles higher for those with a prior infection compared to those without prior infection, signifying lower infectiousness. Ct value declined gradually with age. Ct value was lowest for those who were tested because of symptoms and was highest for those who were tested for travel-related purposes. Ct value was lowest during the exponential-growth phase of the omicron wave and was highest after the wave peaked and was declining. \r\n\r\nConclusions: The BA.2 subvariant appears substantially more infectious than the BA.1 subvariant. This may reflect higher viral load and/or longer duration of infection, thereby explaining the rapid expansion of this subvariant in Qatar.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n[The BA.2 variant may also be slightly better at evading immunity than BA.1, which could be contributing to its rapid spread. Although BA.2 is more contagious than BA.1, clinical data do not suggest a significant difference in disease severity. ...\r\n\r\nBA.2 has been especially prominent in countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Europe. Recent analyses have indicated that it has displaced BA.1 as the dominant omicron sublineage in Denmark, Singapore, India, South Africa, and Austria. The rapid ascent of BA.2 is illustrated by the increase in its prevalence from 20% in the last week of December 2021 to 66% by the third week of January 2022 in Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of BA.2 cases in the United States remains low at 3.8% so far, but health experts expect it to rise. ...\r\n\r\n(<https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/omicron-subvariants-ba-1-vs-ba-2-what-the-latest-data-says#omicron-subvariant-BA.2-overtakes-BA.1>) - Mod.LK]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[4] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 4 Mar 2022)\r\nDate: Fri 4 Mar 2022\r\nSource: WHO [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://covid19.who.int/table>\r\n\r\n\r\n*Daily case reports as of 4 Mar 2022 16:48 CET\r\n\r\nSurveillance\r\n------------\r\nWHO region (no. countries/territories):\r\nTotal confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWestern Pacific Region (19): 26 179 245 (684 775) / 185 082 (940)\r\nEuropean Region (61): 181 275 264 (730 155) / 1 882 512 (2734)\r\nSouth East Asia Region (10): 56 001 277 (56 967) / 764 410 (584)\r\nEastern Mediterranean Region (22): 21 252 125 (12 433) / 335 004 (237)\r\nRegion of the Americas (54): 147 655 931 (174 936) / 2 640 841 (3529)\r\nAfrican Region (49): 8 443 150 (2969) / 170 234 (60)\r\nCases on an international conveyance: 764 (0) / 13 (0)\r\n\r\nConfirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\r\nGrand total: 440 807 7563 (1 662 235) / 5 978 096 (8084)\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[Data by country, area, or territory for 4 Mar 2022 can be accessed at <https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WHO%20Data%20Tables%20MAR4_1646510437.pdf>.\r\n\r\n- The Americas region reported 10.5% of cases and 43.6% of deaths in the past 24 hours having reported more than 147.65 million cases, second to the European region as the most severely affected region.

The panel also indicated that farmers and veterinarians should be trained in the clinical identification of LSD in order to reduce underreporting. \r\n\r\nPreventive vaccination of sick cows is useless.

Her quarry is deer mice. She takes blood samples, looks for scars and fleas, and attaches ear tags.\r\n\r\n\"Mice are fairly trap happy and easy to catch,\" she said. \"But it can be kind of a miserable job in the winter.\"\r\n\r\nKuenzi's goal is to better understand how a type of hantavirus called Sin Nombre spreads through these mouse populations.\r\n\r\nKuenzi, a professor of biology at Montana Technological University, and her colleague Angie Luis, a professor of biology at the University of Montana, are among a growing number of researchers working to predict where viruses may be likely to spill over from animals to humans. Of the emerging human diseases, including the Sin Nombre hantavirus, 60% originate in animals, and 2/3 of those originate in wildlife.\r\n\r\nBy understanding hantavirus and the complex ecology that governs it, Kuenzi and Luis also hope to create a model system to better understand the ecology of many other viruses, including coronaviruses.\r\n\r\nThe researchers have built 6 large enclosures at the Bandy Ranch, a University of Montana research facility. There, they can study how deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_] behave when they're the sole occupants and then introduce the mice's main rodent competitors, voles, to see how mouse populations, mouse behavior, and disease prevalence change.\r\n\r\n\"We're asking how competitors affect the transmission of disease,\" Luis said of the research, recently funded with a $2.5 million National Science Foundation grant. \"We are trying to understand that as we stress animals, as we add or remove competitors, how does that change the transmission?\"\r\n\r\nThe role of biodiversity in zoonotic diseases is complex and can have both positive and negative effects. For example, competition from other rodents can lower deer mice numbers and reduce how often the mice interact, limiting infections. At the same time, the presence of more competitors can stress deer mice, and stress in animals has been shown to lower their immunity and greatly increase their viral load.\r\n\r\nClimate change is also a factor. Warmer temperatures and fluctuations in rain and snow are changing habitats, which can affect infection rates. The 1st recognized outbreak of hantavirus in humans, in 1993, is thought to have been driven by a wet winter that provided more food for mice.\r\n\r\nThe Montana study area has only 2 main rodents, making it a simple system for carrying out research. Kuenzi and Luis are also gathering data in the Southwest, where Sin Nombre is far more prevalent -- and complicated. \"At one site in Arizona, we caught 29 species of rodent-sized small mammals,\" Kuenzi said. The larger number of species appears to decrease the prevalence of the disease, Luis said.\r\n\r\nSin Nombre, Spanish for \"without a name,\" is one of several types of hantavirus. It is transmitted through the inhalation of airborne particles from mouse droppings. The disease is rare in humans but can be deadly. In 1993, the first known outbreak was on the Navajo Nation in the Southwest. It killed 13 people, half of those it infected.\r\n\r\nThe disease is most prevalent in rural areas, where mice and other rodents are common, and public health officials urge people to take special care when cleaning homes or buildings that have been closed for the winter or when working in areas like crawl spaces or vacant buildings where rodents may be present.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Sin Nombre in tent cabins in Yosemite National Park killed 3 people. In 2004, the deputy superintendent of Glacier National Park died from the disease. From Sin Nombre's discovery in 1993 through 2019, fewer than 900 infections were reported in the U.S.\r\n\r\nThe hope for the research in Montana is that it will lead to recommendations on how to manage land in ways that don't increase the prevalence of the disease.\r\n\r\nThis is just one thread in the tapestry of disease ecology. The long list of factors that increase the possibility that pathogens will spill over from animals to humans is getting a lot of attention from researchers around the world in response to the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Viral outbreaks are a product of the ways that humans are altering the natural world, though researchers are seeking to determine precisely how.\r\n\r\nIn the big picture, research from the past 20 years shows that keeping nature intact will help minimize the risk of another pandemic. \"Evidence is mounting that biodiversity dilutes out disease,\" Luis said. \"As we lose biodiversity, we see greater disease prevalence.\"\r\n\r\nWhen animals can move to find food when they need to and avoid humans and domestic animals, \"we are not going to see spillover events,\" said Raina Plowright, a professor at Montana State University, who studies the disease ecology of bats.\r\n\r\nActivities that bring people into contact with wildlife -- such as farming, logging, and building homes in wild areas, all of which change the ecosystem -- may amplify the risk of spillover.\r\n\r\nIt could, for example, drive the competitors of deer mice out completely. \"Deer mice like disturbance,\" Luis said. As land is developed, species that compete with deer mice may scatter, and without competitors, deer mice increase in number. With more mice come more encounters between them and the spread of Sin Nombre.\r\n\r\nEarly studies of biodiversity and disease took place in upstate New York, where the fragmentation of forest habitat by development had led to the loss of foxes, owls, hawks, and other predators. Those changes drove a 5-fold surge in the number of white-footed mice [_Peromyscus leucopus_] , which are potent reservoirs for the bacteria that cause Lyme disease.\r\n\r\nBut the idea that biodiversity has protective effects is more complicated than first thought. \"There are lots of exceptions to this idea that biodiversity dilutes out disease,\" Luis said. \"You can get both positive and negative effects of biodiversity at the same time. There is an overall dilution effect because competitors lower the density of deer mice,\" she said, but there might be amplification from stress caused by competitors.\r\n\r\nKevin Lafferty is an ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's Western Ecological Research Center in Santa Barbara, California, and studies the ecology of parasites. Focusing on the ecology of mice and hantavirus makes sense, he said: \"If wild rodents ... are going to become more abundant because we disturb the environment, then those particular diseases might be the kind of things we should worry about.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the broad notion of protecting biodiversity to prevent disease is \"wishful thinking,\" he said. \"That's a vague and ineffective way to solve human health problems,\" Lafferty said. Instead, he added, researchers should focus on how the viruses' hosts respond to the environment.\r\n\r\nLuis agreed that more work needs to be done on a complicated topic. \"Outbreaks that are moving from animals to humans have only become more common over the last 30 to 40 years,\" Luis said. \"This is not the last pandemic.

That understanding can lead to measures that reduce the risk of human infection. Studies have shown that deer mice are the most common host of hantavirus and are well dispersed throughout Montana. According to the Montana Department of Public Health & Human Services, hantavirus [-related disease] has shown up in about 40% of Montana counties (see Hantavirus - Americas (37): Bolivia (TR), USA (MT) 20180527.5821309). People can become infected with hantavirus when saliva, urine, or droppings from an infected deer mouse are stirred up and inhaled.

The bacteria can come into contact with food and drink through contact with surfaces where the bacteria are located. \"That means you do not have to worry about it being transmitted through the air, like if someone sneezed on you or any of that. This is really a surface problem,\" Tran said.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[In late 2021, an outbreak of shigellosis occurred in San Diego County in Southern California. This increasing cluster is in Humboldt County, which is in the far north of the state.\r\n\r\n_Shigella_ was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10-100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices commoner in men who have sex with men. Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.\r\n\r\nThe bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux), an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing diarrhea). - Mod.LL\r\n\r\nProMED map of Humboldt County, California, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701699,6193>]\n\n[See Also:\nShigellosis - USA: (CA) 20220227.8701699\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nShigellosis - USA (06): (CA) homeless individuals 20211222.8700434\r\nShigellosis - USA (05): (CA) homeless individuals 20211113.8699654\r\nShigellosis - USA (04): (CA) homeless individuals 20211026.8699278\r\nShigellosis - USA (03): (CA) homeless individuals 20211012.8699003\r\nShigellosis - USA (02): (KS) wildlife park, non-zoonotic, RFI 20210811.8587171\r\nShigellosis - USA: (KS) wildlife park, RFI 20210630.8486452\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nShigellosis - India: (KL) 20201226.8048430\r\nShigellosis - Denmark: fresh mint 20201017.7867256\r\nShigellosis - China: (AH) waterborne 20200825.7712409\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nShigellosis - USA: (Guam) 20190319.6375402\r\nFoodborne illness - Mongolia: (UB) fast food chain, shigellosis susp. 20190219.6325716\r\nShigellosis - Israel: (BS) preschoolers 20190126.6278982\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nShigellosis, st sonnei - USA: (VT) retirement community, multidrug resistant 20181107.6132342]\n.................................................sb/ll/tw/mpp"

Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.\r\n\r\nThe classic food-related cluster of _S. enterica_ serotype Typhi in the USA occurred related to a summer house in the (still) wealthy suburb of New York City, Oyster Bay, Long Island, in August 1906. This was the still infamous cluster associated with \"Typhoid Mary,\" or Mary Mallon, an Irish immigrant who was both a food preparer and a typhoid bacillus carrier.\r\n\r\nSome strains of the organism have become quite antimicrobial resistant, particularly ones linked to Pakistan (refer to the See Also section below). - Mod.LL\r\n\r\nProMED map of Fiji: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701848,167>]\n\n[See Also:\nTyphoid fever - Namibia: (Windhoek) 20220303.8701761\r\nTyphoid fever - South Africa 20220217.8701519\r\nTyphoid fever - Congo DR (01) 20220111.8700783\r\nTyphoid fever - Philippines: (NC) 20220105.8700681\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nTyphoid fever - Zambia: (LS) 20211016.8699091\r\nTyphoid fever - Mexico: (TM,SI) 20210928.8698759\r\nTyphoid fever - Congo DR (02) 20210719.8530510\r\nTyphoid fever - Congo DR: (KU) 20210609.8435561\r\nTyphoid fever - Philippines: (Calabarzon) 20210604.8421732\r\nTyphoid fever - Singapore: possible restaurant source 20210215.8192390\r\nTyphoid fever - USA: nonimported XDR Salmonella Typhi infections, 2019-20, alert 20210213.8189506\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nTyphoid fever- Chile: reduced fluoroquine susceptibility 20201022.7880669\r\nTyphoid fever - Pakistan: (KP) 20200721.7591413\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nTyphoid fever - Europe: Ireland, XDR ex Pakistan, ECDC, alert 20191015.6727235\r\nTyphoid fever - Pakistan (04): XDR, travel alert CDC 20191008.6716070\r\nTyphoid fever - Taiwan: ex Pakistan, multidrug resistance 20190926.6696377\r\nTyphoid fever - USA (05): (TX) imported XDR case, possible secondary case 20190922.6688120\r\nTyphoid fever - Australia: ex Pakistan, multidrug resistance 20190918.6679904\r\nTyphoid fever - Pakistan (03): (SD) multidrug resistance 20190626.6539573\r\nTyphoid fever - Denmark: ex Pakistan, multidrug resistance 20190524.6483641\r\nTyphoid fever - USA (02): (MA) food worker, imported 20190522.6480973\r\nTyphoid fever - Pakistan (02): (SD) multidrug resistance 20190220.6326968\r\nTyphoid fever - Pakistan: multidrug resistance 20190212.6313110\r\nTyphoid fever - USA: ex Pakistan, multidrug resistance, CDC 2018 20190110.6252390]\n.................................................ll/tw/mpp"

Researchers found that _Campylobacter_  prevalence and counts in fresh broiler chicken meat was significantly lower in samples of Estonian origin compared to those from Latvia and Lithuania.\r\n\r\nIn the study, 429 chicken meat samples of Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian origin were collected from Estonian retailers and analyzed between September 2018 and October 2019. _Campylobacter_ was isolated in 141 broiler chicken meat samples. Overall, 3, 49, and 89 of Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian origin samples, respectively, were positive.\r\n\r\nAmong positive samples, 62 contained _Campylobacter_ below 100 colony forming units per gram (CFU/g), and in 28 samples, the count exceeded 1000 CFU/g. A higher prevalence of _Campylobacter_ in fresh broiler chicken meat of Lithuanian and Latvian origin in Estonian retail was observed, according to the study published in the journal Poultry Science.\r\n\r\nMore than 1000 CFU/g were found in one Latvian and 27 Lithuanian fresh broiler chicken meat samples. The highest count of 1500 CFU/g in the Latvian sample was detected in February 2019. Among positive samples from Lithuania, high counts ranging from 1000 to 5000 CFU/g occurred throughout the year from October 2018 to August 2019.\r\n\r\nIn Estonia, 348 confirmed cases of campylobacteriosis were registered in 2019. This level is lower than the average in the European Union.\r\n\r\n_Campylobacter jejuni_ genotypes found in both broiler chicken meat and human samples indicate that imported fresh chicken meat is likely the cause of campylobacteriosis in Estonia. Only isolates from Lithuanian chicken meat products overlapped with those from human patients in Estonia, said researchers. A comparison with previous studies revealed a decrease of _ Campylobacter_  prevalence in fresh chicken meat samples of Estonian origin from 15.8 in 2000 to 2002 to 1.8 in this study. Since 2012, the prevalence of Latvian and Lithuanian _Campylobacter_ in chicken meat has increased, from 25.8 to 36.8% and from 10.6 to 66.9%, respectively, but the number of samples taken varied.\r\n\r\nResearchers said a possible explanation for the Estonian results is that strict biosecurity and self-control measures at farm, slaughterhouse, and meat industry levels are applied, plus risk-assessment-based control measures are implemented at all stages of production. Scientists said further research is needed to study other possible sources of _Campylobacter_ infections in Estonia.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n\n[The classical reservoirs for the transmission of campylobacteriosis to man are unpasteurized dairy products and undercooked chicken. - Mod.LL\r\n\r\nProMED map of Estonia: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701846,117>]\n\n[See Also:\n2021\r\n----\r\nCampylobacteriosis, Cryptosporidiosis - Norway: farm, unpasteurized milk 20210323.8264641\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nCampylobacteriosis - USA (02): (WA) chicken liver pate, 2016 20170928.5347818\r\nCampylobacteriosis - USA: canine, human, alert 20170913.5312884\r\nCampylobacteriosis - UK (03): (England) chicken liver pate 20170912.5311662\r\n2014\r\n----\r\nCampylobacteriosis - UK (02): chicken packaging, alert 20141125.2988592\r\nCampylobacteriosis - UK: (Scotland) barbecued poultry 20140719.2620444\r\nCampylobacteriosis - USA (02): (NV) race participants, 2012 20140501.2443247\r\n2013\r\n----\r\nCampylobacteriosis - USA (12): 2012, uncooked chicken livers 20131107.2044022]\n.................................................sb/ll/tw/mpp"

Birds in 5 commercial facilities and 37 backyard flocks in the quarantined area are being tested.\r\n\r\nTests verified the virus in the Buena Vista County flock late Sunday [6 Mar 2022], Kaisand said. The destroyed birds will be disposed of on location, he said. The owner has the option of composting the birds or burying them.\r\n\r\nOn Monday [7 Mar 2022], Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster declaration for the county, allowing the state agriculture department and other agencies to assist with detection, tracking, and monitoring of the disease and containment, disposal, and disinfection.\r\n\r\nIowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said Monday [7 Mar 2022] the outbreak at a commercial facility could have trade implications. The US Department of Agriculture will report the case to global animal health and trade officials and wait to see if any restrictions are placed on Iowa birds.\r\n\r\nLast week, the Iowa and US agriculture departments said a backyard flock of 42 chickens and ducks, where bird flu was detected in Pottawattamie County, had been destroyed and incinerated.\r\n\r\nKaisand said he believes wild birds infected the turkey facility as they migrate across the US. He sees no connection between the Pottawattamie County and Buena Vista County outbreaks.\r\n\r\nAgriculture officials also set up a quarantine area in Pottawattamie County, but with just 3 backyard flocks in that zone, officials only required that the birds be monitored for signs of infection.\r\n\r\nOver the weekend, avian influenza also was discovered in commercial flocks in Maryland, South Dakota, and Missouri, bringing to 12 the states with reported outbreaks detected.\r\n\r\nKaisand said poultry producers should put up \"as many firewalls as possible between your poultry and wild birds,\" adding that \"separating any connections between wild birds and domestic birds is absolutely critical this year [2022].\"\r\n\r\nState and federal agencies said none of the birds nor any poultry products from flocks where avian influenza is detected will reach US food supplies. No human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been detected in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe virus' spread is particularly concerning in Iowa, which leads the nation in egg production, with 55 million laying hens, and ranks 7th nationally for turkey production, raising 12 million birds annually.\r\n\r\nKaisand said it's important to note that there is no cure or vaccine for bird flu.\r\n\r\nThe virus can wipe out a flock within 48 hours. A 2015 outbreak led to the destruction of 32.7 million laying hens, turkeys, and other birds in Iowa. That was about 2/3 of the 50.5 million that were destroyed nationally in what is considered the worst foreign animal disease outbreak on record.\r\n\r\nThe US Department of Agriculture helps the state and producers get rid of potentially infected birds and disinfect facilities, Naig said. The federal government also will help producers financially with the loss of the birds. \"This is a devastating blow to them economically,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe said he believes industry and state and federal government officials are better prepared than in 2015, with tighter biosecurity measures limiting access to facilities and preventing contamination of birds' water and feed.\r\n\r\n\"None of us want to be facing a foreign animal disease again here in Iowa, but we have learned a lot,\" Naid said, adding that \"we're ready to respond quickly\" when an outbreak is identified to prevent the virus' spread.\r\n\r\nLast week, Naig said Iowans with flocks should be \"on high alert\" over the next couple months while wild birds are migrating. The state is part of the Mississippi flyway, a migration route for millions of birds annually.\r\n\r\nNaig said the discovery of disease in Iowa on 1 Mar [2022] was \"not unexpected,\" given reports it had been detected in wild, backyard, and commercial flocks, mostly in eastern US states.\r\n\r\nKaisand urged poultry owners to immediately report to the state and federal agriculture departments any birds that become sick or die unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nOfficials say poultry products remain safe to eat when properly handled and cooked.\r\n\r\nUS Department of Agriculture figures for 2020, the latest available, show Iowa's poultry industry receipts were USD 1.28 billion.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Donnelle Eller]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n[ProMED map of Buena Vista County, Iowa, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701868,3627>]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] Missouri (Stoddard County): commercial poultry\r\nDate: Fri 4 Mar 2022\r\nSource: Dexter Statesman [edited]\r\n<https://www.dexterstatesman.com/story/2937635.html>\r\n\r\n\r\nStoddard County Health Center Director Ben Godwin stated in a social media release that a flock of broiler chickens in Stoddard County has tested positive for avian influenza (AI). Godwin said the test was confirmed by the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).\r\n\r\nGodwin's release said samples from the flock were tested at the University of Missouri Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network NAHLN, and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe APHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in Missouri on a joint incident response to the positive test. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease; birds from the flock will not enter the food system.\r\n\r\nGodwin said according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern.\r\n\r\nGodwin said cases of avian influenza in humans is very rare but could cause flu-like symptoms. Additionally, Godwin said no human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.\r\n\r\nGodwin said everyone should cook all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] to kill bacteria and viruses.\r\n\r\nAs part of the existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in the areas around the affected flock. Godwin's release said the United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and migratory wild bird populations. Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. The APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at <https://www.aphis.usda.gov/.../dtf-resources/dtf-resources>.\r\n\r\nGodwin said the USDA will report these finding to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. He said the USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts.\r\n\r\nThe OIE trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region posing a risk of spreading the disease of concern.\r\n\r\nGodwin said APHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and backyard flocks detected in a state but will not announce subsequent detections in the state. All cases in commercial and backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at <https://www.aphis.usda.gov/.../avian-influenza/2022-hpai>.\r\n\r\nAccording to Godwin's release, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS's toll-free number in addition to practicing good biosecurity.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the APHIS is urging producers to consider bringing birds indoors when possible to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs being depopulated during a disease response.\r\n\r\nThe APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at <http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov>.\r\n\r\nAvian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus that can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese, and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or \"H\" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or \"N\" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of H and N proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains that circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high), the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[ProMED map of Stoddard County, Missouri, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701868,30006>]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] Maryland (Cecil County): commercial chickens\r\nDate: Mon 7 Mar 2022 5:21 p.m. EST\r\nSource: WBAL TV [edited]\r\n<https://www.wbaltv.com/article/avian-influenza-flu-commercial-chickens-cecil-county/39334609>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in a flock of commercial chickens in Cecil County, Maryland, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nSamples from the flock were tested at the University of Delaware's Allen Laboratory, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN), and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) announced in a statement released Saturday [5 Mar 2021].\r\n\r\nThe USDA said state officials quarantined the affected premises, and action is being taken to prevent the spread of the disease.

Everyone must be diligent about biosecurity of the birds. Be on the alert for ill birds in your flock, and if you are a hunter, take notice if there are ill birds in flocks you may be hunting. If you are able, bring your birds inside. They can be in your garage or something like a back room. Even in winter, birds will need some type of ventilation, so a fan may be needed, but, of course, severe cold is always an issue as well. The point is to do what is necessary to protect your birds.\r\n\r\nWhile most of these articles do not specifically mention H5N1, it is highly likely this is the specific strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza.\r\n\r\nMigrating birds can transport the virus without the migratory bird appearing to be ill.

They are being treated in hospitals in Victoria.\r\n\r\nThe man remains in a serious condition in ICU. The child has been discharged from ICU but continues to receive hospital care due to the serious nature of their illness.\r\n\r\nSeveral more people in NSW are undergoing further testing, and more cases are expected to be confirmed over the coming days and weeks.\r\n\r\nEarlier\r\n-------\r\nNSW Health has confirmed one highly probable case of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in an NSW resident and is warning the public to be vigilant and safeguard themselves against mosquito bites.\r\n\r\nThe person is in ICU in a stable condition. They are a resident in the NSW-Victoria border region.\r\n\r\nSeveral more patients in NSW are undergoing further testing, and more cases are expected to be confirmed over coming weeks.\r\n\r\nLocally acquired cases of JEV have never previously been identified in NSW in animals or humans. JEV is usually only found in far northern Australia and neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\nJEV can cause severe neurological illness with headache, convulsions, and reduced consciousness in some cases.\r\n\r\nThere is no specific treatment for JEV.\r\n\r\nJEV is a viral illness spread by mosquitoes. It can infect animals as well as humans and has been confirmed in samples from a number of pig farms in regional NSW.\r\n\r\nThe virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and it cannot be caught by eating pork or pig products.\r\n\r\nNSW Health Acting Chief Health Officer Marianne Gale said the best way to avoid infection is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, which are most active between dusk and dawn.\r\n\r\n\"NSW Health is cautioning people undertaking outdoor activities such as camping and fishing to carefully consider their plans. This is especially important for people planning activities near waterways or where mosquitoes are present, particularly the Murray River and its branches,\" Dr Gale said. \"People should be particularly vigilant given the recent wet weather conditions, which have led to very high mosquito numbers that may increase further in the coming days and weeks.\"\r\n\r\nNSW Health is working closely with the NSW Department of Primary Industries and other state and territory agencies to determine the extent to which the virus is circulating, through animal testing and mosquito monitoring.\r\n\r\nMosquito control activities are being carried out in the vicinity of farms where pigs are confirmed to have been infected by JEV, and NSW Health is arranging vaccination of workers on affected farms.\r\n\r\nSimple actions you can take to avoid mosquito bites include avoid going outdoors during peak mosquito times, especially at dawn and dusk, wear long sleeves and pants outdoors (reduce skin exposure), use repellent, especially those that contain DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus, and reduce all water-holding containers around the home where mosquitoes could breed, as mosquitoes only need a small amount of liquid to breed.\r\n\r\nThe warning follows detection of a mosquito-borne disease Ross River virus found in mosquitoes at Picnic Point, a suburb north of the Georges River, on 2 occasions in the past month.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Eva Kolimar]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n\n[The state of New South Wales (NSW) now has 2 confirmed human cases of Japanese encephalitis. One of these, currently in serious condition in the hospital's ICU, appears likely to be one of the patients reported in a 3 Mar 2022 post (see item [1] in Japanese encephalitis - Australia (03): (VI, QL) spread 20220305.8701785). Pigs in NSW have also tested positive for JE virus infection (see Japanese encephalitis - Australia (02): (QL, NS, VI) pig, OIE 20220304.8701778). Pigs are JE-virus-amplifying hosts and capable of providing infectious blood meals to many mosquito vectors.\r\n\r\nNo reports have been issued yet of the frequency and locations where JE virus has been found in vector mosquitoes, although vector surveillance is doubtless going on. Given the reports of flooding and rains in eastern Australia, mosquito populations are likely to remain abundant with ongoing JE virus transmission to people and pigs. Avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure, other than vaccination, for people to avoid JE virus infections. - Mod.TY\r\n\r\nProMED map of New South Wales, Australia: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701869,284>]\n\n[See Also:\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (04) 20220305.8701811\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (03): (VI, QL) spread 20220305.8701785\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (02): (QL, NS, VI) pig, OIE 20220304.8701778\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia: alert 20220228.8701705\r\n2001\r\n----\r\nJapanese enceph. virus - Australia: nat. barriers (02) 20010201.0218\r\nJapanese enceph. virus - Australia: natural barriers 20010115.0118\r\n2000\r\n----\r\nJapanese encephalitis virus, mosquitoes - Australia 20000710.1143\r\n1998\r\n----\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (03) 19981201.2311\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (02) 19980509.0922\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia 19980402.0604\r\n1996\r\n----\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Torres Strait, Australia 19960423.0777\r\n1995\r\n----\r\nJE - Australia 19950523.0337\r\nJE - Australia (credit) 19950525.0340\r\nJE - Australia (first record) 19950427.0229]\n.................................................sb/jh/ty/tw/jh"

According to police inspector BL Maheriya of Visnagar taluka police station, the wedding of former Congress leader Wazir Khan Pathan's son was held on [Thu 3 Mar 2022] and the next day on [Fri 4 March] a dinner was organized at Savala with \"12 000-15 000 guests in attendance\". Of those, around 1057 guests started exhibiting symptoms of food poisoning such as vomiting and diarrhea and were admitted at various health facilities in Gandhinagar.\r\n\r\nSP Parthrajsinh Gohil said that after being informed of the incident by hospital authorities, police registered a 'janvajog' (station diary entry) and pursuant to the same, an inquiry by the police has been initiated. \"FSL and FDCA have taken samples of sweets and other food items served at the dinner and the results are awaited. The Health department too is working on this and has taken samples of the vomit and stool. Prima facie it seems the caterer may have been negligent and there could have been adulteration in the food,\" Gohil said. Approximately 1250 guests have been affected with mild to moderate symptoms.

The cases for 2022 are alarming, just 3 months into 2022. \"Historically we've seen 2-5 cases of hepatitis A per year and generally those have been sporadic cases,\" said Dr Cynthia Morrow, the health district director for the Roanoke City and Alleghany Health District. The cases in 2022 are anything but sporadic, and the current count of 31 people infected has nothing to do with the Famous Anthony's [restaurant] outbreak that started late in 2021. Most of the cases, however, do have something in common. \"The majority of our cases, about 80 percent, are identified in individuals who use injection drugs,\" said Morrow.\r\n\r\nThat's where Lisa Via comes in. She's the manager of the Drop-In Center North and she sees injection drug users daily. \"We have focused on the education on hep A for the injection drug community,\" said Via. Her program, which focuses on harm reduction and offers a free needle exchange, has jumped from 460 participants to almost 650 in just over 3 months.\r\n\r\nVia says the hepatitis A outbreak started in January 2022. The exact cause is unknown, but health officials do know how it spreads and why. \"Some people who use injection drugs may also be un-housed so they may not have access to some of the things that we take for granted in terms of things like hand hygiene, sinks, and proper places to go to the bathroom,\" said Morrow.\r\n\r\nAccording to Morrow, preventing hepatitis A is really just as simple as washing your hands. It's also why you should care about this outbreak, as those infected can spread it through food preparation and everyday things you touch. \"It's kind of, again, a whole community project that we're working on. Everyone focused on Famous Anthony's because it was upfront, but the health department let us know it was injection drug users, boots on the ground immediately, started with the education behind it,\" said Via.\r\n\r\nThat education includes opportunities to get vaccinated, one of the other main defenses against the disease. These vaccines are free and Via says a few dozen folks have already rolled up their sleeves. \"You know the grassroots formation of harm reduction is meeting people where they are, so we meet people every week where they are. The Health Department in doing these clinics is meeting people where they are, they have offered these services that our clients need and don't always get the services for a lot of reasons,\" said Via.\r\n\r\nVia and Morrow hope to see a shift in numbers in the next few weeks.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Ashley Boles]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[These cases are independent of the restaurant-associated cases previously reported.

If more than 5% of the surface of tubers are covered with scab, they are unable to be sold for the table market. The disease is also an issue for processing and, of course, even worse for seed production. But not much has been done on a national level to address the problem.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Claudia Goyer, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, started a common scab research project. Different species are causing common scab, but the one that is found pretty much everywhere in the world is _Streptomyces scabies_. Other species found regionally include _S. acidiscabies_ and _S. turgidiscabies_. They all produce a group of plant toxins called thaxtomins, which is how common scab causes the brown lesions on potatoes.\r\n\r\nSamples of potatoes with common scab symptoms were collected in several states for testing. Scab pathogens from infected tubers were characterised using molecular testing. So far, the scientists have a collection of 300 isolates with at least 20 genetic groups. This shows that there is a lot of diversity in the pathogens, which might explain why finding solutions to control the disease has been so difficult.\r\n\r\nAfter determining the genetic groups, the team started to look at how they are distributed across Canada. They are also trying to find ways to control common scab in fields, such as growing certain crops before potatoes to hold soil moisture, which reduces scab incidence, or biopesticides. Full project results are to be released in 2023.\r\n\r\n[Project details: <https://potatoresearchcluster.ca/common-scab/>]\r\n\r\n[Byline: Ashley Robinson]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Common scab of potato caused by the bacterium _Streptomyces scabiei_ has been reported from most potato-growing areas worldwide. Symptoms include cracks and lesions on tubers that coalesce into large rough or corky areas, but above-ground plant parts appear normal. Scab reduces crop quality, although scabby potatoes are generally fit to eat and store well. Infection occurs during early tuber formation; if soils are dry at that stage, disease levels can be high. The pathogen can also affect other root crops, such as carrot, parsnip, radish, beet, and turnip. In South Africa, _S. scabiei_ was also found to be associated with pod wart disease on peanut crops (see ProMED post 20190722.6581049). Each of the crops can serve as reservoir hosts in case of successive rotations with the others and so increase overall scab incidence. The disease is favoured by alkaline soils.\r\n\r\nThe bacterium is soil-borne and can survive on infected tubers and plant debris. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include cultural techniques such as 3-5-year rotations with non-host crops, increase of organic matter in fields to increase soil moisture, and adjusting soil pH. Use of certified scab-free seed tubers is essential. Commercial potato cultivars differ in their levels of susceptibility, but none with complete resistance to scab are currently available. Research is being carried out into biological control of scab by antibiotic-producing strains of _Streptomyces_.\r\n\r\nSimilar symptoms on potato tubers can also be caused by powdery scab due to the fungus-like organism _Spongospora subterranea_, which is also the vector for _Potato mop-top virus_ (see, for example, ProMED-mail post 20100616.2020).\r\n\r\nMaps\r\nCanada (with provinces):\r\n<http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/Canada_Provinces_and_territories_map.png>\r\n\r\nPictures\r\nCommon scab on potato:\r\n<http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/IPM/images/potatoes/diseases/common-scab/potato_common-scab_06_zoom.jpg>,\r\n<http://thegrower.org/sites/default/files/news-images/e%20potato%20scab.jpeg>,\r\n<https://ag.umass.edu/sites/ag.umass.edu/files/fact-sheets/images/potato_scab.jpg> and\r\n<http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/Images/Potatoes/PotatoScab/PotatoScabColl.jpg>\r\nClose-up of initial scab lesions:\r\n<http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/IPM/images/potatoes/diseases/common-scab/potato_common-scab_01_zoom.jpg>\r\nScab on beet:\r\n<http://mtvernon.wsu.edu/path_team/DiseaseGallery/dg13L.jpg>\r\n\r\nLinks\r\nInformation on potato scab and _S. scabiei_:\r\n<https://apps.lucidcentral.org/ppp/text/web_full/entities/potato_common_scab_293.htm>,\r\n<http://www.plantwise.org/KnowledgeBank/Datasheet.aspx?dsid=51840>,\r\n<https://agriculture.vic.gov.au/biosecurity/plant-diseases/vegetable-diseases/common-scab-of-potatoes>,\r\n<https://www.ag.ndsu.edu/potatoextension/common-scab>,\r\n<https://www.potatopro.com/about/common-scab> and\r\n<https://www2.ipm.ucanr.edu/agriculture/potato/Common-Scab/>\r\nPotato common scab life cycle:\r\n<https://www.canr.msu.edu/uploads/236/73214/5_Fig.PNG>\r\n_S. scabiei_ taxonomy and synonyms:\r\n<http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/1930>\r\nTaxonomy of other _Streptomyces_ species via:\r\n<https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/1883>\r\n- Mod.DHA]\n\n[See Also:\n2019\r\n----\r\nPod wart disease, peanut - Americas: 1st rep (USA) 20190722.6581049\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nCommon scab, potato - UK 20170904.5294699\r\n2007\r\n----\r\nStreptomyces common scab, potato - USA (ID): new strain 20070427.1368]\n.................................................sb/dha/tw/jh"

The cases were reported in the pastoralist and remote county of Isiolo, some 270 km (160 mi) north of the capital Nairobi.\r\n\r\n\"We have an additional death to the 3 that we had reported earlier,\" Patrick Amoth, director general of Kenya's health ministry, told AFP (see Yellow fever - Africa (01): Kenya (IS) 20220305.8701824).\r\n\r\nThere is no specific treatment for yellow fever, a viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and found in parts of Africa and Latin America's Amazon region. The disease is transmitted by the same mosquitoes which spread Zika and dengue [viruses].\r\n\r\nKenya, which has not experienced an outbreak of yellow fever since the 1990s, detected its 1st case in decades on 12 Jan [2022] and had, until last week, isolated 15 patients with fever, jaundice, and muscle pain.\r\n\r\nThe risk of further spread was low as the outbreak was in a sparsely populated region, Amoth said.\r\n\r\n\"Because of the demographics of Isiolo, in terms of the number of people and how people are widely spread apart, it makes it a little easier to control,\" Amoth said.\r\n\r\nHowever, 25% of the country has been classified as high risk, he said.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak is adding to Kenya's health challenges as it emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic and battles a severe drought in Isiolo and other northern counties.\r\n\r\nThe disease is transmitted from humans to humans via the mosquito, which sucks up the virus and then [after a few days] hands it on when it bites someone for a blood meal.\r\n\r\nYellow fever vaccinations are routinely recommended for travellers going on safaris in Kenya. Bed nets, insect repellent, and long clothing are also considered good forms of protection.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this report.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, this small 3-victim outbreak has added a 4th case. The low vaccination rate is of concern. One hopes that the rapid response will lead to a prompt vaccination campaign in the affected areas. A YF vaccine shortage was reported in 2020 (see Yellow fever - Africa (04): Kenya vaccine shortage 20200130.6935353). Apparently that shortage has ended.\r\n\r\nAs noted in the previous post, the previous outbreak was in 1991-1993 (see references below). During that outbreak, a report indicated that nearly all confirmed infections were acquired between 1500 and 1800 m (4900-5900 ft) in the Tugen Hills (Baringo district, Rift Valley province). Transmission appeared to be entirely sylvatic, that is, all confirmed cases were independent of other human cases and had acquired their infection by contact with mosquitoes that had been infected by feeding on viraemic monkeys. Infected mosquitoes (_Aedes africanus_ and _Ae. keniensis_) were captured close to a cluster of human cases at about 1700 m (5577 ft) (see Yellow fever - Africa (17): Kenya, background 20110504.1377). Although the mosquito vectors in the current outbreak have not been reported, the mosquito surveys done in the 2 counties reported above, though distant from the current outbreak, do indicate that vector mosquitoes capable of urban transmission are present in Kenya.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------\r\n1.

This is the 1st positive detection of EHM in Texas this year (2022).\r\n\r\nThe horse was tested after showing neurologic signs consistent with EHM. The premises has been quarantined, and TAHC staff are working closely with the owner and local veterinarian to monitor the infected horse and enforce biosecurity measures on the premises.\r\n\r\n\"While the horse showed clinical signs, it was kept home until transferred to a local veterinary clinic for treatment,\" said Dr. Angela Lackie, assistant executive director of Animal Health Programs. \"The horse traveled back home after clinical signs resolved.\"\r\n\r\nEHM is a neurologic disease of horses linked to the equine herpesvirus. Neurological signs appear as a result of damage to blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include fever of 102 deg F [39 deg C] or greater (fever most often comes before neurologic signs), nasal discharge, lack of coordination, hindquarter weakness, leaning or resting against a fence or wall to maintain balance, lethargy, urine dribbling, head tilt, diminished tail tone, and penile paralysis.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember these signs are not specific to EHM, and diagnostic testing is required to confirm EHV-1 infection. If you suspect your horse has been exposed to EHV-1, contact your local veterinarian.\r\n\r\nFor more information on EHM please visit <https://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/brochures/TAHCBrochure_EquineHerpesMyeloencephalopathy.pdf>.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about biosecurity measures owners can take to keep their horses healthy, visit <http://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/brochures/TAHCBrochure_BiosecurityEquine.pdf>.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] Wisconsin (Waukesha County): horse\r\nDate: Mon 17 Jan 2022\r\nSource: The Horse [edited]\r\n<https://thehorse.com/1107779/wisconsin-filly-confirmed-with-respiratory-ehv-1/>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection has confirmed a filly in Waukesha County with respiratory equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). She was placed in voluntary quarantine under the care of a veterinarian.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] Wyoming (Park County): horse\r\nDate: Tue 25 Jan 2022\r\nSource: The Horse [edited]\r\n<https://thehorse.com/1108196/wyoming-horse-tests-positive-for-neurologic-ehv-1/>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wyoming State Veterinarian has reported a Park County horse has tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) after exhibiting signs of neurologic disease. The horse was isolated, and the remaining horses on the premises were placed under a 10-day quarantine.\r\n\r\nEHV 101\r\nHerpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpesvirus myeloencephalitis (EHM, the neurologic form).\r\n\r\nIn many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.\r\n\r\nHorses with EHM usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.\r\n\r\nHerpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread.\r\n\r\nCurrent EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\r\n\r\n******\r\n[4] California (Riverside County): Desert International Horse Park (DIHP)\r\nDate: Sun 27 Feb 2022\r\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\r\n<http://outbreaknewstoday.com/equine-herpes-virus-1-outbreak-in-california-41267/>\r\n\r\n\r\nUS Equestrian released a frequently asked questions (FAQ) Friday [25 Feb 2022] to answer questions about the equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) outbreak at the Desert International Horse Park (DIHP) in Thermal, California:\r\n\r\nWhat is equine herpesvirus?\r\nEquine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) is a virus is present in the environment and found in most horses all over the world. Horses are typically exposed to the virus at a young age with no serious side effects.\r\n\r\nAre there different strains of EHV-1?\r\nThere are 2 strains of EHV-1:\r\n- the wild-type (aka non-neuropathogenic) strain; and\r\n- the mutant-type (aka neuropathogenic) strain of EHV-1.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note neurologic signs have been identified with both strains of the virus.\r\n\r\nWhat is equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM)?\r\nEHM is the neurological disease syndrome caused by the EHV-1. In this syndrome, the EHV-1 virus damages blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord, causing the various neurologic clinical signs.\r\n\r\nHow does the disease spread?\r\nEHV-1 is spread by direct horse-to-horse contact. The virus may also be spread indirectly through contact with objects contaminated with the virus, such as clothing, human hands, equipment, tack, trailers, feed, water buckets, and wash rags. The virus can become airborne but only for short distances.\r\n\r\nHow many horses have tested positive for EHV-1 on the grounds at DIHP or associated with horses having been on the grounds of DIHP?\r\nTo date, 18 horses have confirmed positive for EHV-1. Some of these horses tested positive after leaving DIHP.\r\n\r\nHow many horses have tested positive for EHM that were on the grounds at DIHP?\r\nTo date [27 Feb 2022], 3 horses from DIHP have confirmed positive for EHM (EHV-1 infection with neurological signs). One of these horses had to be euthanized.\r\n\r\nIs there a relationship between DIHP and the euthanized horse having competed at LAEC?\r\nAt this time, there is no known direct link between the DIHP and the euthanized horse confirmed positive for EHM (EHV-1 infection with neurological signs) that competed at LAEC.\r\n\r\nDid horses leave DIHP and within 7 days compete at LAEC against LAEC's protocols?\r\nWe have reports 4 horses left DIHP and within 7 days competed at LAEC against their protocols. Those horses were removed when this became known to management. USEF is investigating these reports.\r\n\r\nIs there a relationship between DIHP and the euthanized horse in San Juan Capistrano?\r\nThe euthanized horse in San Juan Capistrano confirmed positive for EHM (EHV-1 infection with neurological signs) had not been to DIHP but was exposed to other horses upon their return from DIHP. One of the returned horses confirmed positive for EHV-1.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[5] California: 2022 FEI Longines Jumping Nations Cup postponed\r\nDate: Mon 7 Mar 2022\r\nSource: Horse Talk [edited]\r\n<https://www.horsetalk.co.nz/2022/03/07/equine-herpesvirus-postponements-five-horses-dead/>\r\n\r\n\r\nAn outbreak of equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) in California in the US has forced the postponement of many events, following an order from the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA).\r\n\r\nEquine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) has been detected in multiple horses in several counties in California, and at least 5 deaths have been reported.\r\n\r\nEquine herpesvirus causes respiratory disease, abortion, neonatal death, and the neurological disease known as EHM. It spreads in aerosolized secretions, by direct contact, and by contact with surfaces containing infected secretions. Shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days.\r\n\r\nTo reduce disease spread, the California State Veterinarian recommends all hunter/jumper events (the most affected group) be postponed for the next 28 days, all equine events be postponed for the next 14 days, and all non-essential horse movements postponed for at least 14 days.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation considers an event when horses from different home premises are brought together at a single location and include, but are not limited to, competitions of any discipline (in state or out of state), rodeos, educational riding clinics, and any travel of horses to an outside facility for lessons or casual/social gathering, etc. Sanctioned horse racing tracks are exempt from this recommendation.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak has forced the cancellation of the 2022 FEI Longines Jumping Nations Cup event, which was to be held in San Juan Capistrano from 10-15 May 2022. The event was the 3rd qualifier in the Nations Cup series, and one of 3 North/Central America and Caribbean Division events. The cancellation by organisers Blenheim EquiSports has the full support of both the FEI and the US Equestrian Federation (USEF).\r\n\r\nFEI Veterinary Director Goran Akerstrom said the FEI had been closely monitoring the development of the EHV-1 outbreak in California. \"Stopping the movement of horses is key to prevent further spread of the virus,\" he said.\r\n\r\nUSEF CEO Bill Moroney said while the cancellation was disappointing for organiser and competitors, \"the safety and welfare of our members and their horses is our top priority and most important responsibility. We are fully supportive of this decision while the mitigation and containment efforts for EHV-1 are still ongoing in California.\"\r\n\r\nHorse owners must immediately isolate any horses exhibiting neurologic signs and consult their veterinarian under state reporting requirements. Owners must practice good biosecurity when they move horses in emergency situations or for veterinary care, avoid other horses, and don't share tack/equipment that hasn't been properly cleaned and disinfected, including farrier and veterinary equipment.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[6] Pennsylvania (Bucks County): Parx Track, horse euthanized\r\nDate: Mon 7 Mar 2022\r\nSource: DRF.com [edited]\r\n<https://www.drf.com/news/two-parx-barns-under-quarantine-after-suspected-equine-herpes-infection>\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo barns at Parx racetrack outside Philadelphia have been placed under quarantine due to a suspected case of equine herpesvirus, a highly contagious disease, according to the track's racing secretary.\r\n\r\nDavid Osojnak, the racing secretary, said the quarantines were put in place after a horse that exhibited signs of equine herpesvirus was euthanized at the track on Sunday [6 Mar 2022]. The track has not determined how long the quarantine will be in place, but the track is also not allowing horses to ship out for the time being, Osojnak said. [One could argue clinical signs were enough to warrant euthanasia, while others would say there should have been laboratory confirmation. However, the clinical signs, and perhaps the animal's deteriorating condition, the risk of infection to other very valuable horses, and not spreading the disease prompted the veterinarian and the owner to euthanize prior to testing. There are no details provided here on why euthanasia was elected over testing. - Mod.TG]\r\n\r\nAdditional tests are being performed on the dead horse to confirm the horse was positive for the virus, Osojnak said.\r\n\r\nParx is hosting 4 USD 100 000 stakes on Tuesday [8 Mar 2022], and several New York-based trainers said on Monday [7 Mar 2022] they intended to scratch their horses from the races. The track is also planning to have a mandatory payout of its jackpot-style bet, the Philly Big 5, on its Wednesday [9 Mar 2022] card. The carryover going into the Monday [7 Mar 2022] card was nearly USD 450 000.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday [6 Mar 2022], the New York Racing Association put in place a ban on shippers from Parx racetrack due to concern over the case.\r\n\r\n\"On Sunday morning, NYRA's director of veterinarians was informed of a possible neurological issue with a horse based at Parx,\" said Patrick McKenna, a spokesman for NYRA. \"For precautionary reasons, NYRA will not be accepting entries from Parx-based horses until the investigation is complete and the issue is resolved to the satisfaction of NYRA.\"\r\n\r\nOfficials for Pennsylvania state racing commission would not comment when contacted on Monday [7 Mar 2022] or did not return phone calls.\r\n\r\nEquine herpesvirus can sometimes be lethal, and it can easily spread among horse populations if it is not contained.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Matt Hegarty and Dave Grening]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[The vaccine for EHV-1 does tend to decrease the severity of the neurological signs, but thus far there is no vaccine that prevents the neurological form of the disease.\r\n\r\nHorse owners are encouraged to vaccinate their animals against EHV and use other core vaccines, such as those for eastern and western equine encephalitis (EEE, WEE), West Nile virus (WNV), tetanus, and rabies. Most of these are annual vaccines, except EEE, which needs revaccination approximately every 3-4 months in areas where the disease is prevalent.\r\n\r\nThe following is from the American Association of Equine Practitioners:\r\n\r\n\"Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) and equine herpesvirus type 4 (EHV-4) infect the respiratory tract, the clinical outcome of which can vary in severity from sub-clinical to severe respiratory disease. Clinical infection is characterized by fever, lethargy, anorexia, nasal discharge, cough, and mandibular lymphadenopathy. Infection of the respiratory tract with EHV-1 and EHV-4 typically first occurs in foals in the first weeks or months of life, but recurrent clinical infections are seen in weanlings, yearlings, and young horses entering training, especially when horses from different sources are commingled. Equine herpesvirus type 1 can cause major outbreaks of abortion in naive mares, the birth of weak nonviable foals, or a sporadic neurologic disease (equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy-EHM) secondary to lytic infection of endothelial cells resulting in the development of thombi in the small blood vessels supplying the spinal cord and brain.\r\n\r\n\"Both EHV-1 and EHV-4 spread primarily by the respiratory route, by direct and indirect (fomite) contact with nasal secretions, and, in the case of EHV-1 and infrequently EHV-4, by contact with aborted fetuses, placental and fetal fluids, and placentae. Like herpesviruses of other species, these viruses establish latent infection in the majority of horses, which become asymptomatic carriers of one or both viruses. Such horses may experience reactivation of either virus, resulting in replication in certain white cell elements in the blood and short-term shedding of the virus when stressed. Some pregnant mares in which reactivation of virus occurs, may abort. Existence of a carrier state seriously compromises efforts to control these diseases and explains why outbreaks of EHV-1 or EHV-4 can occur in closed populations of horses.\r\n\r\n\"Because both viruses are endemic in many equine populations, most mature horses have developed some immunity through repeated natural infection; thus, most mature horses do not develop serious respiratory disease when they become reinfected but may be a source of infection for other susceptible horses. In contrast, horses may not be protected against the abortigenic or neurologic forms of the disease, even after repeated infection, and mature or aged horses are in fact more commonly affected by the neurologic form of the disease than juvenile animals.\r\n\r\n\"Recently, a genetic variant of EHV-1 has been described (defined by a single point mutation in the viral DNA polymerase [DNApol] gene) that is more commonly associated with neurologic disease (EHM). This mutation results in the presence of either aspartic acid (D) or an asparagine (N) residue at position 752. Molecular diagnostic techniques can identify EHV-1 strains carrying these genetic markers. The finding of a neuropathogenic variant of the virus can have implications for the management of EHV-1 outbreaks, or individual horses actively infected with these strains. It is important to understand that both virus genotypes can and do cause neurological disease. However, infection with D752 strains can result in a higher clinical attack rate and a higher case fatality rate. It is estimated that 80-90% of neurological disease is caused by D752 isolates, and 10-20% by N752 isolates. It is possible that 5-10% of all horses normally carry the D752 form (this estimate is based on limited studies at this time). In the face of an active outbreak of EHV-1 disease, identification of a D752 isolate may be grounds for increased concern about the risk of development of neurological disease.\r\n\r\n\"Primary indications for use of equine herpesvirus vaccines include prevention of EHV-1-induced abortion and reduction of severity and duration of signs of respiratory tract disease (rhinopneumonitis) in foals, weanlings, yearlings, [and] young performance and show horses that are at high risk for exposure. Many horses produce post-vaccinal antibodies against EHV, but the presence of those antibodies is not indicative of protective immunity. Repeated vaccination appears to reduce the frequency and severity of disease and limits the occurrence of abortion storms. As with all forms of equine herpes viral disease, biosecurity management is of primary importance for control of abortion caused by EHV-1.\r\n\r\n\"Please check with your state or provincial animal health office about which diseases are reportable.\r\n\r\n\"Vaccines\r\n---------\r\n\"Inactivated vaccines\r\nA variety of inactivated vaccines are available, including those licensed only for protection against respiratory disease, and 2 that are licensed for protection against both respiratory disease and abortion. Performance of the inactivated respiratory vaccines is variable, with some vaccines outperforming others. Performance of the inactivated abortion/respiratory vaccines is superior, resulting in higher antibody responses and some evidence of a cellular response to vaccination.\r\n\r\n\"Modified live vaccine\r\nA single manufacturer provides a licensed modified live EHV-1 vaccine. It is indicated for the vaccination of healthy horses 3 months of age or older as an aid in preventing respiratory disease caused by equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1).\r\n\r\n\"EHM\r\nNone of the available vaccines have a label claim to prevent the neurologic form of EHV-1 infection. It has been suggested that vaccines may assist in limiting the spread of outbreaks of EHM by limiting nasal shedding of EHV-1 and dissemination of infection. For this reason, some experts hold the opinion that there may be an advantage to vaccinating in the face of an outbreak. If this approach is pursued, only afebrile and asymptomatic horses should be vaccinated, and protection against clinical EHM should not be an expectation. The vaccines with the greatest ability to limit nasal shedding and viremia of the neuro virulent strain include the vaccines licensed for control of abortion (Pneumabort-K(R) & Prodigy(R)), Calvenza(R), and the MLV vaccine (Rhinomune(R)).\r\n\r\n\"Vaccination schedules\r\n----------------------\r\n\"Adult, non-breeding, horses previously vaccinated against EHV: frequent vaccination of non-pregnant mature horses with EHV vaccines is generally not indicated as clinical respiratory disease is infrequent in horses over 4 years of age. In younger/juvenile horses, immunity following vaccination appears to be short-lived. It is recommended that the following horses be revaccinated at 6-month intervals:\r\n- horses less than 5 years of age\r\n- horses on breeding farms or in contact with pregnant mares\r\n- horses housed at facilities with frequent equine movement on and off the premises, thus resulting in an increased risk of exposure\r\n- performance or show horses in high-risk situations, such as racetracks. More frequent vaccination than at 6-month intervals may be required in certain cases as a prerequisite for entry to the facility. See here for USEF Vaccination Rule (<https://www.usef.org/forms-pubs/ANcxoLX1gNs/equine-vaccination-rule-gr845>).\r\n\r\n\"Adult, non-breeding horses unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history: Administer a primary series of 3 doses of inactivated EHV-1/EHV-4 vaccine or modified-live EHV-1 vaccine. A 4 to 6 week interval between doses is recommended.\r\n\r\n\"Pregnant mares: Vaccinate during the 5th, 7th, and 9th months of gestation using an inactivated EHV-1 vaccine licensed for prevention of abortion. Many veterinarians also recommend a dose during the 3rd month of gestation, and some recommend a dose at the time of breeding. Vaccination of mares with an inactivated EHV-1/EHV-4 vaccine 4 to 6 weeks before foaling is commonly practiced to enhance concentrations of colostral immunoglobulins for transfer to the foal. Maternal antibody passively transferred to foals from vaccinated mares may decrease the incidence of respiratory disease in foals, but infection is common in these foals and may result in clinical disease and establishment of the carrier state.\r\n\r\n\"Barren mares at breeding facilities: Vaccinate before the start of the breeding season and thereafter based on risk of exposure.\r\n\r\n\"Stallions and teasers: Vaccinate before the start of the breeding season and thereafter based on risk of exposure.\r\n\r\n\"Foals: Administer a primary series of 3 doses of inactivated EHV-1/EHV-4 vaccine or modified-live EHV-1 vaccine, beginning at 4 to 6 months of age and with a 4 to 6 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses. Administer the 3rd dose at 10 to 12 months of age. Immunity following vaccination appears to be short-lived, and it is recommended that foals and young horses be revaccinated at 6-month intervals. The benefit of intensive vaccination programs directed against EHV-1 and EHV-4 in foals and young horses is not clearly defined because, despite frequent vaccination, infection and clinical disease continue to occur.\r\n\r\n\"Outbreak mitigation\r\n--------------------\r\nIn the face of an outbreak, horses at high risk of infection, and consequent transmission of infection, may be revaccinated. Administration of a booster vaccination is likely to be of some value if there is a history of vaccination. The simplest approach is to vaccinate all horses in the exposure area, independent of their vaccination history. If horses are known to be unvaccinated, the single dose may still produce some protection. It is essential to understand that strict quarantine, isolation, and monitoring protocols are more effective at controlling outbreaks than any vaccination protocol.\r\n\r\n\"Controversy persists among experts regarding possible association between frequent vaccination against EHV and the risk of developing EHM. The absence of any controlled challenge studies designed to examine this question makes it unwise to offer any definitive conclusion.\r\n\r\n\"Horses having been naturally infected and recovered: Horses with a history of EHV infection and disease, including neurological disease, are likely to have immunity consequent to the infection that can be expected to last for 3 to 6 months (longer in older horses). Booster vaccination can be resumed 6 months after the disease occurrence.\" - Mod.TG\r\n(<https://aaep.org/risk-based-vaccination-guidelines/equine-herpesvirus-rhinopneumonitis>)\n\nProMED maps:\nTexas, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701891,245>\nWaukesha County, Wisconsin, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701891,11881>\nPark County, Wyoming, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701891,14420>\nRiverside County, California, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701891,4364>\nCalifornia, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701891,204>\nBucks County, Pennsylvania, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701891,766>\nUnited States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701891,106>]\n\n[See Also:\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (02): USA, horse 20220223.8701604\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (01): USA, horse 20220207.8701309\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (12): USA (MN,OR) horse 20210923.8695753\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (11): USA (ID) horse 20210729.8554229\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (10): USA (PA) horses, new variant 20210614.8447919\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (09): USA, horse 20210407.8294841\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (08): USA (MD), guidelines 20210331.8281365\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (07): USA, horse 20210318.8253379\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (06): USA (FL, PA) horse 20210306.8232386\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (05): Canada (QB) horse, RFI 20210226.8214558\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (04): Canada (ON) horse 20210221.8205196\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (03): Canada (QB) horse 20210220.8203803\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (02): USA (WA) horse 20210218.8199360\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (01): USA (VA) horse 20210213.8189608\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (10): USA (CA) horse 20201212.8013803\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (09): USA (CA) horse 20201127.7974676\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (08): USA (NY) Belmont Stakes, horse 20200628.7519563\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (07): Canada (ON), USA (IA), horse 20200528.7391992\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (06): Canada (ON), USA (ND) horse 20200520.7359991\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (05): USA (MD, SD) horse 20200315.7094760\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (04): USA, horse 20200304.7050014\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (03): USA (VA) horse 20200227.7025815\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (02): USA (NY, NE, TX) horse 20200215.6991136\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (01): Canada (ON), USA (CA) horse 20200118.6897360\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (20): USA (CA, UT) horse 20191019.6735538\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (10): USA (AZ, TX) horse 20190410.6415673\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (05): USA (NV) horse 20190321.6380047\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (01): USA (NY) equine 20190114.6258019\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nEquine herpesvirus - USA (26): (PA) equine 20181212.6206655\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (20): USA (VA, ND) equine 20180522.5812573\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America (10): USA (MD, WY, NJ) 20180318.5693959\r\nEquine herpesvirus - North America: USA (NY) 20180111.55532842017]\n.................................................sb/tg/tw/jh"

However, [a small number of] these animals are susceptible to the disease and may become potential reservoirs for maintaining the disease, in addition to being a threat to endangered wild species. A survey by the Institute of Biomedical Sciences (ICB) at USP and 3 other institutions made it possible to understand the extent of the outbreak of bovine tuberculosis in wild animals at the Pampas Safari theme park, located in the municipality of Gravatai, in Rio Grande do Sul (RS), until 2017. The results serve as an alert for the need for a disease control program among these animals, whether in nature, in zoos or parks.\r\n\r\nDeveloped in partnership with the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa), the Secretary of Agriculture, Livestock and Rural Development of Rio Grande do Sul (SEAPDR) and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science (FMVZ) at USP, the research shows that the disease was probably transmitted from cattle to at least 16 different species of animals, mostly deer, such as _Rusa unicolor_, fallow deer and red deer. Three genetic variants of the disease-causing bacteria, _Mycobacterium bovis_, were found.\r\n\r\nThe work, published in the journal Transboundary and Emerging Diseases, is the first study to show the prevalence of the disease in an environment that is not fully enclosed, such as a zoo.\r\n\r\n\"These numbers, both for variants and species of infected animals, are probably higher because there is no specific diagnostic test for bovine tuberculosis in wild animals,\" says Daiane Lima, a researcher at Embrapa's Animal Research Group and 1st author of the paper. \"The problem was certainly much bigger than reported; we only took a fragment of what happened there, with tests on dead animals\", adds Flabio Ribeiro de Ara\u00fajo, researcher at Embrapa's Animal Research Group.\r\n\r\nBovine tuberculosis is an infectious disease that affects domestic and wild animals and humans. Transmission to humans occurs mainly by ingestion (raw unpasteurized milk, in most cases) or inhalation of aerosols in close contact with animals with the disease. In the case of animals, there is no treatment or vaccines, only measures to prevent and contain the spread of outbreaks, which involve the slaughter of the animal after diagnosis. The disease, of a chronic nature, causes economic losses for beef and dairy cattle, in addition to sanitary barriers.\r\n\r\n\"Worldwide, the notification of bovine tuberculosis to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) is mandatory. But in Brazil, cases in wild animals do not need to be reported by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply. We want this work to help correct this legal vacuum, given that the Ministry's National Bovine Tuberculosis Control Program does not take wild animals into account\", says Ana Marcia Sa Guimaraes, coordinator of the Laboratory for Applied Research to Mycobacteria at the ICB, where part of the tests was carried out.\r\n\r\nIn the research, samples of material from sacrificed animals were analyzed, collected between 2003 and 2018. In addition to samples of llamas that died, samples from the deer diagnosis performed by the SEAPDR veterinary team were also included, following guidelines of researchers and the diagnostic protocol of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), USA, which also took care of the euthanasia of clinically diagnosed animals.\r\n\r\nOver the years, samples from these animals were sent to Embrapa and FMVZ, which were responsible for carrying out the diagnosis through bacterial culture and the positive samples were submitted to genomic sequencing. Thus, it was possible to understand whether there was transmission between the animals and whether there were multiple introductions of the bacterium over time.\r\n\r\nAt the ICB, the samples underwent bioinformatics analyses, where all the DNAs were captured and compared to assess whether there were mutations in the bacterium. \"We evaluated the samples to see which genomes would be closer to each other and which would be further apart and which could be of different origins\", explains Cristina Zimpel, a doctoral student at the institute. \"With the study, we were able to show, through the 3 variants found, that there were at least 3 different introductions of the disease in the park during the period\", adds Guimaraes.\r\n\r\nEverything indicates that the outbreak in the Pampas Safari was due to 2 factors: inadequate feeding of these animals, which compromised their immunity and ability to fight the pathogen, and the overcrowding of animals of different species in a small space.\r\n\r\n\"The deer that became infected were euthanized. But as the Pampas Safari is a private place and the farm where it was located still exists, it is not possible to say that the outbreak is over\", recalls Guimaraes. The researchers estimate that the disease may have spread to other states, as there was intense activity in the park of selling live animals to other farms.\r\n\r\nThe group seeks new partnerships to analyze other cases of bovine tuberculosis transmission in wild animals. \"We want to talk to people responsible for zoos in different regions of the country to see if they have already witnessed cases of the disease and what has been done, and then analyze them in order to have a real idea of its prevalence in Brazil\", says Guimaraes. At the same time, the group will continue to carry out studies on the transmission and diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle and buffaloes.\r\n\r\nIn the researchers' assessment, a disease control program aimed at wild animals is essential, with mandatory notification of cases and the establishment of clear diagnostic criteria. Without these measures, the risk of spreading the disease in Brazil, through wild animals, tends to increase.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n\n[Bovine tuberculosis due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ has one of the widest host ranges of all the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (MTC) and can readily spill over into a variety of domestic and wild mammals, including humans.\r\n\r\nIn the British Isles, _M. bovis_ found a suitable alternative host in which to thrive, the badger (_Meles meles_). Badgers turned out to be such competent hosts that they are playing an important role in maintaining the pathogen. Sika deer (_Cervus nippon_) emerged as another competent alternative host in Ireland. In the USA, white-tail deer and elk are considered the primary reservoir and maintenance hosts of bovine tuberculosis. Research on potential alternative hosts in South America has been scarce. In addition to native deer populations, many exotic deer species have been introduced in South America, becoming invasive species. The potential role of those native and exotic deer populations in the dynamics of _M. bovis_ must be taken into account and assessed.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\nLima et al. 2021.

Mod.AS, edited]\r\n<https://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/article-print-page/1.10658321>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe head of public health services at the Ministry of Health, Sharon Elroi-Price, today [Mon 7 Mar 2022] referred to the case in Jerusalem where a 4-year-old girl with polio was diagnosed, saying that \"there are at least tens or hundreds more infections (which are probably asymptomatic). We do not expect there to be a wave of children coming with symptoms, but we understand that the virus is spreading. A vaccinated child is protected.\" \r\n\r\nIn a conversation with journalists, Elroi-Price emphasized: \"We are very far from an uncontrollable outbreak, we prevent it by locating those around the case and vaccinating the unvaccinated among them. Elroi-Price added that her office wants to \"make sure that all the children, especially in the Jerusalem district, are in an optimal vaccination status, meaning they have undergone the complete childhood vaccination regime according to the recommendations of the Ministry of Health. Regarding polio, there are 4 vaccinations given during the first year of life. The current recommendations are to precede the first vaccination, momentarily only in the Jerusalem district, to 6 weeks and the 2nd one to 12 weeks of age, in order to make sure earlier protection is conferred. \r\n\r\nShe noted that the District Health Bureau and the Jerusalem Municipality are conducting an extensive investigation, and that a project manager has been recruited to locate the people who were in close contact with the child who was diagnosed with polio yesterday [Sun 6 Mar 2022], \"extending the sampling of sewage to more locations within and around the focus for fecal cultures, to fence the area in question.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to tests conducted on sewage by the Public health services in the Ministry, the polio virus is only found in the Jerusalem area.\r\n\r\nYesterday [Sun 6 Mar 2022], the Ministry of Health announced that a 4-year-old girl from Jerusalem had been diagnosed with polio, the first case in Israel since 1988. The girl has not been vaccinated against the virus as part of routine vaccinations. The girl was brought for treatment in Hadassah Ein Kerem. Prof. Shimon Reif, director of the children's department at the hospital said the initial suspicion was raised due to neurological symptoms like weakness in the leg muscles and other symptoms. \"Tests conducted involving a pediatric neurologist confirmed that it was polio,\" Reif said. The girl was treated at the hospital for one week, and after her condition improved, she was transferred to rehabilitative treatment due to a muscular injury - a familiar phenomenon among polio patients. \r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Health also announced that the Jerusalem District Health Bureau has opened an epidemiological investigation, approaching contacts for specific guidance. According to the findings of the investigation further recommendations will be decided upon.\r\n\r\nThe polio strain that the girl was infected with is one of the strains found in the vaccine, which has been genetically modified and may cause disease in those who are not vaccinated against the virus. As far as is known, the infected girl developed symptoms manifested by weakness on one side of the body, but did not need to be hospitalized. The case was later discovered by the Ministry's performed routine monitoring of sewage in the area where the girl lives. Such a finding sometimes appears in the monitoring, but so far no cases of morbidity have been detected.\r\n\r\nThe polio vaccine is given in 4 doses, at the ages of 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age. An additional booster is given at school at the age of 7. The vaccination rate, with the 4 doses among those born in 2020 in Jerusalem, is 83%, but there are areas where the vaccination rates are particularly low and stand at about 50%. The Ministry of Health is currently segmenting the population to concentrate efforts and vaccinate those who have not yet been vaccinated.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Efrati Ido]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2]\r\nDate: Tue 8 Mar 2022\r\nSource: JDN [in Hebrew, machine trans., edited]\r\n<https://www.jdn.co.il/health/1708720/>  \r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the polio case, the head of the public health services, Dr. Sharon Elroi-Price, held a briefing for the ultra-Orthodox media and warned of the risk of not being vaccinated. \"70-80% of those infected will not suffer from symptoms, but there is a situation where the virus penetrates the bloodstream to the nervous system and can in a percentage of cases cause neurological symptoms of paralysis, weakness, and can even damage the respiratory muscles to the point of respiratory assistance.\"\r\n\r\nThe head of the health service added that \"the virus is preventable. The vaccine can be given and is very effective and safe. The vaccine is based on a killed virus to protect the people who get it - but to eradicate polio, a combination of live attenuated vaccine is needed. The children first receive the vaccine from the killed virus and only then the attenuated live vaccine.\r\n\r\n\"The purpose of the attenuated live vaccine is to produce antibodies in the digestive tract so that they cannot be carriers of the virus and infect others. The killed vaccine protects against the virus, and the animal protects against the transmission of the virus.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Elroi-Price told reporters that \"in 2005 it was decided to stop giving the attenuated live vaccine after they came to the conclusion that they had managed to eradicate the polio virus, however in 2013 the polio virus was identified in the south and it was decided to do a 2-drop operation. In 2014, it was decided to return the attenuated live and killed vaccine that has always been part of the vaccination program in Israel.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Elroi Price expanded on the various monitoring methods in Israel, one through the sewage system and the other through the doctors, noting that \"recently a polio virus has been identified in the sewage and we see it recurring at several points and we believe the virus is already circulating in the Jerusalem area.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Elroi-Price went on to refer to a case found in recent days and said: \"We do not specify the gender of the patient but for convenience say a child about 4 years old, not vaccinated, came to the pediatrician 2 weeks ago with symptoms of lower body weakness and falls. The first sample was negative for polio, but repeated samples were found positive for polio and were defined as verified for polio.\r\n\r\n\"In polio, the clinical cases are the tip of the iceberg,\" stressed Elroi-Price. \"When there is someone who manifests symptoms, it means that there are dozens and hundreds of others who already have the virus. When a child is identified with a neurological symptom, it is the tip of the iceberg and more must be sought.\r\n\r\n\"Last night we received confirmation of the diagnosis, we opened an epidemiological investigation, contact was made with the kindergarten and contacts. We sent a message to the medical directors at the HMOs, informing them that there was a case and drawing their attention to being vigilant.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Elroi-Price: \"The epidemiological investigation revealed that there are 10 contacts that are considered close within the family, and 20 more children and staff in the kindergarten. The investigation with the family is in processes and includes retrieving fecal samples.\"\r\n\r\nThe head of the public health services noted that \"irreversible damage may be caused to the infected, children and adults. Children who have not been vaccinated should get vaccinated. Even in schools - this is the moment to get vaccinated\" she pleaded.\r\n\r\nHowever, Elroi-Price asked to reassure the public, noting that \"due to confidentiality, it is not possible to specify [geographic area?], but at the moment what can still be said, is that the virus was detected in sewage only in the Jerusalem area and not elsewhere. We will increase sewage monitoring throughout the country, especially in Jerusalem \"To locate the area more accurately,\".\r\n\r\nShe noted that the Ministry of Health has assisted its Mother and child care stations with additional manpower to reinforce the queue and to extend the hours of operation beyond the ordinary ones. \"Right now, we are building a plan that will address this.\" Dr. Elroi asked the ultra-Orthodox reporters to assist in transmitting the information and necessity of immunization to reach all sectors of the ultra-Orthodox population.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Elhanan Toledano]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[The above media reports fill in some of the blanks raised in yesterday's post (see Poliomyelitis update (09): Israel (JM) VDPV, MOH, RFI 20220307.8701864).

As of 0.00am, [Mon 7 Mar 2022], the CHP was investigating 9410 additional confirmed cases, 3997 additional asymptomatic cases and 11 743 cases with pending case status in the past 24 hours (i.e. there were 25 150 additional cases that tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus in those 24 hours). Hong Kong has recorded a total of 496 767 cases that tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus so far.\r\n\r\nThe newly reported cases consist of 32 imported cases and 25 118 locally acquired cases. The CHP is continuing with epidemiological investigations on the cases.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as of 0.00am, [Mon 7 Mar 2022], a total of 2074 deaths related to COVID-19 during the 5th wave (since [31 Dec 2021]) were recorded, with 2070 and 4 deaths reported from the Hospital Authority and public mortuaries respectively. Hong Kong has so far recorded a total of 2287 deaths related to COVID-19.\r\n\r\nAs at 4pm today [Mon 7 Mar 2022], a total of 417 373 cases that tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been reported in the past 14 days [21 Feb --to 6 Mar 2022], including 417 279 locally acquired cases and 94 imported cases. A list of buildings related to the cases is available at the \"COVID-19 Thematic Website\" (<www.coronavirus.gov.hk>).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, among the earlier cases reported, there were cases (including pending cases) changed to confirmed, asymptomatic or re-positive cases. As of yesterday [Sun 6 Mar 2022], the total number of confirmed cases was 202 704, while the figures for asymptomatic cases, re-positive cases, pending/unknown cases recorded since [1 Jan 2022] were 90 715, 10 and 178 188 respectively.\r\n\r\nAlso, as the passenger flight (GA876) operated by Garuda Indonesia arriving in Hong Kong from Jakarta, Indonesia, on [Sun 6 Mar 2022] had 26 passengers who tested positive upon arrival, the DH thus invoked the Prevention and Control of Disease (Regulation of Cross-boundary Conveyances and Travellers) Regulation (Cap. 599H) to prohibit the landing of passenger flights in Hong Kong from Jakarta operated by Garuda Indonesia from [8 to 21 Mar 2022].\r\n\r\nPeople with positive or preliminary positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test results will receive an SMS notification about the result, together with a request to fill in an electronic form (<www.chp.gov.hk/cdpi>) to submit information, including those on family members living in the same household. This is to facilitate the work of the CHP such as epidemiological investigation and arrangement of hospital admission, isolation and quarantine. People who receive the relevant SMS should check the personal information and information on testing in the SMS carefully and fill in the electronic form as soon as possible to provide accurate and complete information.\r\n\r\nThe spokesman for the CHP stressed that the local situation of COVID-19 infection became severe recently and there is a continuous increase in the number of cases involving mutant strains that carry higher transmissibility. With the higher transmissibility and risk of infection of the omicron mutant strain, the CHP strongly appeals to the community to continue to comply with the social distancing measures, avoid going out and refrain from participating in unnecessary or crowded activities or gatherings (particularly religious or cross-family activities and gatherings). This would lower the risk of infection and prevent the virus from spreading in the community.\r\n\r\nThe spokesman reminded that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe cases and deaths from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. They can provide effective protection to those vaccinated in preventing serious complications and even death after infection. People who are yet to receive vaccination, especially senior citizens, chronic patients and other immunocompromised persons who face a higher chance of death after COVID-19 infection, should get vaccinated as early as possible for self-protection and to reduce the risk of falling seriously ill and death should they get infected. Meanwhile, a person who gets COVID-19 and influenza at the same time may be more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. Influenza vaccination may reduce the likelihood of hospitalisation and the length of stay. In addition, seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all people aged 6 months or above except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccination early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on the CHP's website (<www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/17980.html>).\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n[from FluTracker, S Shiloh (Editor, Senior Moderator)\r\n<https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-other-health-threats/china-covid-19-sept-13-2020-may-31-2021/940537-china-hong-kong-chp-investigates-9-410confirmed-and-3-997-asymptomatic-additional-sars-cov-2-virus-cases-with-11-743-cases-pending-status-march-7-2022>]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] China: surge in cases\r\nDate: Mon 7 Mar 2022\r\nSource: AP News [edited]\r\n<https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-business-pandemics-beijing-5b59073852beb0e4073583eab18f2900>\r\n\r\n\r\nChina is seeing a new surge in COVID-19 cases across the vast country, despite its draconian \"zero tolerance\" approach to dealing with outbreaks.\r\n\r\nThe mainland on [Mon 7 Mar 2022] reported 214 new cases of infection over the previous 24 hours, with the most, 69, in the southern province of Guangdong bordering on Hong Kong, which has been recording tens of thousands of cases per day.\r\n\r\nAnother 54 cases were reported in the Jilin province, more than 2000km (approx. 1200mi) to the north, and 46 in the eastern province Shandong.\r\n\r\nIn his annual report to the national legislature [Sat 5 Mar 2022], Premier Li Keqiang said China needs to \"constantly refine epidemic containment\" but gave no indication Beijing might ease the highly touted \"zero tolerance\" strategy.\r\n\r\nLi called for accelerating vaccine development and \"strengthening epidemic controls\" in cities where travelers and goods arrive from abroad.\r\n\r\n\"Zero tolerance\" requires quarantines and lockdowns on entire communities and sometimes even cities when as few as a handful of cases have been detected. Chinese officials credit the approach -- along with a vaccination rate of more than 80% -- with helping prevent a major nationwide outbreak, but critics say it is taking a major toll on the economy and preventing the population from building up natural immunity.\r\n\r\nNo new cases were reported in Beijing and the city was largely back to normal, although masks continue to be worn in public places indoors.\r\n\r\nOne area that continues to feel the effects of tight COVID-19 control is the religious sector. Three of Beijing's most famous Catholic churches, Buddhist temples and mosques stated on [Sun 6 Mar 2022] that they had been ordered closed in January [2022] with no date given on reopening.\r\n\r\nEven before the pandemic, such institutions were under heavy pressure from the Communist authorities to follow through on demands from leader Xi Jinping that all religious centers be purged of outside influence, including the physical appearance of places of worship.\r\n\r\nThe latest daily case numbers mark some of the highest since the initial outbreak in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019 that is believed to have sparked the pandemic.\r\n\r\nThey bring China's total to 111 195 with 4636 deaths, according to the National Health Commission. At present, 3837 people are receiving treatment for COVID-19, many of them infected with the omicron strain.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[According to The Hill (<https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/public-global-health/597102-china-reports-highest-covid-19-tally-since-pandemic>), China on (Mon 7 Mar 2022) recorded the highest single day tally of infections since the outbreak in Wuhan at the beginning of the global pandemic. \r\n\r\nThe country reported 526 cases, including 312 asymptomatic patients, according to Bloomberg. (<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-07/china-reports-most-daily-covid-infections-since-wuhan-outbreak?srnd=premium>).\r\n\r\nShanghai, which has seen few significant outbreaks, reported almost 50 cases, while Qingdao saw 163, likely the result of a spike among students at a high school.\r\n\r\nChina has continued to deploy its zero-tolerance protocols, which include widespread testing and intensive lockdowns, strict policies that the country has used to keep infection rates low throughout the pandemic. \r\n\r\nChina and Hong Kong are among the final countries still upholding strict COVID-19 policies after places like Australia have moved to treat the virus as an endemic.\r\n\r\nEarlier this month (March 2022), Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam told citizens not to panic as people flooded grocery stores in anticipation of a lockdown with rising infections. \r\n\r\nLam has said there would not be a citywide lockdown, and her administration is seeking to maintain calm as it plans an expansive testing system. \r\n\r\nAccording to Reuters, Hong Kong is reporting an average of 43 093 new infections each day as of (Sunday 6 Mar 2022) (see <https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/hong-kong/> for graphics). - Mod.LK]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] New normal\r\nDate: Mon 7 Mar 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/experts-map-out-new-normal-us-enters-third-pandemic-year>\r\n\r\n\r\nAs America enters the 3rd year of the COVID-19 pandemic and approaches the 2-year anniversary of business and school shutdowns put in place when little was known about the novel coronavirus, a group of public health experts have published a new roadmap laying out how the country can enter the \"new normal\" stage of the pandemic and manage the virus without eliminating it (<https://www.covidroadmap.org/>).\r\n\r\nThe roadmap recommends against future school closings, suggests the United States will need to manufacture 1 billion at-home COVID-19 tests per month, and says the nation can lift pandemic restrictions when it is tallying 165 or fewer deaths per day from the virus.\r\n\r\nThe authors begin the roadmap by acknowledging where America stands: fatigued with the pandemic, some having stopped all COVID-19 protocols, while others still extremely cautious. In the middle are millions who are confused about how to comport themselves now that vaccines and therapeutics make COVID-19 a more manageable disease.\r\n\r\nThe roadmap was co-authored by 24 US experts, including 2 from the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, publisher of CIDRAP News.\r\n\r\nMeasures may end when deaths fall dramatically\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\"The pandemic and its restrictive measures should end when COVID death rates decline to those of a bad influenza season,\" the authors write. That translates to roughly 60 000 deaths per year, or 165 per day.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 44 800, with 1539 daily deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker. In the past week cases fell by 31%, hospitalizations fell 23%, and deaths fell 19%.\r\n\r\nIn the best-case scenario, the authors write, widespread use of vaccines and previous infection will limit the ability of the virus to cause extensive deaths.\r\n\r\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID Data Tracker shows 65.1% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 76.5% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 44% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster.\r\n\r\nTesting, air quality key parts of roadmap\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nWhite House officials say more money is urgently needed from Congress to bolster COVID-19 testing supplies and guarantee that uninsured Americans keep getting free treatment for the virus, the Associated Press reports (<https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-congress-7bba01ec15bdc406c793bc835f717cd1>).\r\n\r\nExpanding test-to-treat options and making widely available at-home COVID-19 tests is 1 of the main 12 recommendations made by the authors of the roadmap. The roadmap suggests that the US develop the capacity to manufacture 1 billion at -home COVID-19 tests per month.\r\n\r\nRoadmap coauthor Michael Mina, MD, PhD, the chief science officer of eMed, a company that sells COVID-19 tests, told CIDRAP News that tests are no longer needed to simply stop the transmission chain of the virus. Instead, they will be explicitly linked to gaining access to COVID-19 treatments.\r\n\r\n\"Linking tests to treatment has already been made a priority of the administration. Making the whole test-to-treat process work at home means that people will get tested and thus treated in time for the oral antiviral treatments to be maximally beneficial,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Effective, accessible treatment changes the balance of this pandemic. And, moving forward, it will be one of the major advances and advantages associated with access to rapid testing at home.\"\r\n\r\nThe roadmap also emphasizes a need for schools and businesses to improve their air quality. Moreover, it emphases that school shutdowns should be avoided at almost all costs, and that most schools should and can go maskless in the near future.\r\n\r\nStarting today [Mon 7 Mar 2022], masks for public school students in New York City are optional, the New YorkTimes reports. It is one of the biggest school districts in the country (<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/nyregion/new-york-city-public-schoolchildren-head-to-the-first-day-of-class-without-masks.html>).\r\n\r\nIn addition to testing, air quality, and school guidelines, the roadmap also covers the need to investigate and invest in treatments for \"long COVID,\" to invest in public health infrastructure, and to ensure that American healthcare workers are well-equipped with personal protective equipment in the future.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\nwith thanks to John Wherry \r\n\r\n******\r\n[4] Social determinants of health\r\nDate: Mon 7 Mar 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/covid-deaths-vary-race-community-social-factors>\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial determinants of health (SDOH) tied to COVID-19 death rates varied by race and community type in the first year of the pandemic, suggests an observational spatial analysis involving 3142 counties in all 50 US states and Washington, DC. The study was published late last week in JAMA Network Open.\r\n\r\nSDOH are nonmedical factors, such as where people live and work, that influence health outcomes such as COVID-19 infection and death.\r\n\r\n\"Racial disparities in health largely emanate from the inequitable access to social, economic, and physical or built environmental conditions resulting from racism in the US,\" the researchers wrote. \"Specifically, racism interacts with and exists within societal structures and systems to shape the major SDOH.\"\r\n\r\nLimited Internet access tied to more deaths\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nUniversity of Chicago researchers analyzed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 data from [22 Jan 2020 to 28 Feb 2021], identifying counties with high proportions of residents of a single race (Black, Hispanic, or White) and high coronavirus-related death rates as \"concentrated longitudinal-impact counties.\"\r\n\r\nAmong 3142 total counties, 531 were classified as concentrated longitudinal-impact counties, with 11% having a large Black population relative to other counties, 6.3% having a large Hispanic population, and 1.1% having a large share of White residents.\r\n\r\nOverall, 489 254 people in the included counties died. All concentrated longitudinal-impact counties had significantly higher COVID-19 death rates than other counties. Median deaths per 100 000 residents were 231.4 in such counties with a large Black population, 218.8 in such counties with a large proportion of Hispanic residents, and 251.8 in such counties with a large White population. In contrast, the median death rate in other counties was 128.6 per 100 000.\r\n\r\nWhile the 33 concentrated longitudinal-impact counties with a large proportion of White residents had a higher death rate per 100 000 residents, many more such counties had higher Black and Hispanic concentrations, which the researchers said indicates that the latter counties had a higher COVID-19 death toll than all White concentrated longitudinal-impact counties (deaths, 138 315 and 195 852 vs 2586). \r\n\r\nAcross all types of communities, those with limited Internet access--particularly in urban areas--had higher death rates. \"Adopting an asset-based approach, we believe this finding suggests that more awareness is needed about the essential asset of technological access to reliable information, remote work, schooling opportunities, resource purchasing, and/or social community,\" the study authors wrote. \"Populations with limited internet access remain understudied and are often excluded in pandemic research.\"\r\n\r\nIncome inequality and preventable hospitalizations\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nMany concentrated longitudinal-impact counties with the largest percentages of Black (67.1%) and Hispanic residents (55.6%) had a higher proportion of working-age people than the national median. And 78.8% of counties with a large White population had a higher percentage of people 65 years and older than the national median.\r\n\r\nOf concentrated longitudinal-impact counties with a large White population, 69.7% were in rural areas, while 57.6% of counties with a large Hispanic population were located in urban areas, and those with a large Black population were in rural, suburban, and urban areas.\r\n\r\nMost concentrated longitudinal-impact counties with a relatively large Black population had disadvantages, such as greater income inequality (85.6%) and more preventable hospital stays (81%). Among counties with a large proportion of Hispanic residents, 65.7% had high percentages of residents with no health insurance.\r\n\r\nAmong concentrated longitudinal-impact counties with large proportions of White residents, 78.8% had a large population of older adults, and 72.7% had limited access to quality healthcare.\r\n\r\nFuture research is needed to identify dimensions and regional patterns of SDOH to address health disparities and guide policies and programs, the authors noted. \"A more complex model that uses geospatial and temporal patterns to reflect spatial effects and dynamic community aspects (eg, changes in policies, unemployment), in addition to existing SDOH measures and human behaviors, is needed for future analysis,\" they wrote.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Mary Van Beusekom ]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n[Citation.

This cross-sectional study found an association between different SDOH measures and COVID-19 mortality that varied across racial and ethnic groups and community types. Future research is needed that explores the different dimensions and regional patterns of SDOH to address health inequity and guide policies and programs. \r\n\r\n\"What are social determinants of health?\r\n\"Social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. They include factors like socioeconomic status, education, neighborhood and physical environment, employment, and social support networks, as well as access to health care.\r\n\r\n\"Though health care is essential to health, research shows that health outcomes are driven by an array of factors, including underlying genetics, health behaviors, social and environmental factors, and financial distress and all of its implications. While there is currently no consensus in the research on the magnitude of the relative contributions of each of these factors to health, studies suggest that health behaviors and social and economic factors are the primary drivers of health outcomes, and social and economic factors can shape individuals' health behaviors. There is extensive research that concludes that addressing social determinants of health is important for improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities. Prior to the pandemic there were a variety of initiatives to address social determinants of health both in health and non-health sectors. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated already existing health disparities for a broad range of populations, but specifically for people of color.\" (<https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/tracking-social-determinants-of-health-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/>). - Mod.LK]\r\n\r\n********\r\n[5] WHO: Daily new cases reported (as of 7 Mar 2022)\r\nDate: Mon 7 Mar 2022\r\nSource: WHO [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://covid19.who.int/table>\r\n\r\n\r\n*Daily case reports as of 7 Mar 2022 16:48 CET\r\n\r\nSurveillance\r\n------------\r\nWHO region (no. countries/territories):\r\nTotal confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWestern Pacific Region (19): 28 026 116 (588 296) / 187 935 (835)\r\nEuropean Region (61): 183 021 306 (431 512) / 1 889 201 (1590)\r\nSouth East Asia Region (10): 56 169 589 (47 730) / 766 022 (394)\r\nEastern Mediterranean Region (22): 21 321 989 (31 627) / 336 834 (336)\r\nRegion of the Americas (54): 148 106 582 (99 985) / 2 647 988 (1237)\r\nAfrican Region (49): 8 450 266 (1557) / 170 308 (8)\r\nCases on an international conveyance: 764 (0) / 13 (0)\r\n\r\nConfirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\r\nGrand total: 445 096 612 (1 200 707) / 5 998 301 (4400)\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[Data by country, area, or territory for 7 Mar 2022 can be accessed at:\r\n<https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WHO%20Data%20Tables%20MAR7_1646760366.pdf>.\r\n\r\n- The Americas region reported 8.3% of cases and 28.1% of deaths in the past 24 hours having reported more than 148.10 million cases, 2nd to the European region, as the most severely affected region.

Virus transmission between prey and predators and scavengers has been shown for HPAI virus (H5N1), with reported deaths in crows, birds of prey, and even mammals (carnivores). However, the transmission of avian influenza viruses has not been sustained within predator and scavenger populations, suggesting that these represent dead-end hosts.\r\n\r\nThe white-tailed eagle (_Haliaeetus albicilla_) is a very large species of sea eagle widely distributed across temperate Eurasia. It is not considered threatened.

This species is classified as vulnerable as it has a small, regionally declining population as a result of displacement following habitat conversion in its breeding grounds, mortality caused by lead poisoning in inland Japan, reduced breeding rate in the Magadan District caused by climate change, and reduced breeding success predominantly due to predation of nestlings by brown bears on Sakhalin Island.

Another suspected outbreak has been recorded in the Pirkanmaa region but patient samples have not been serotyped. People fell sick between early and mid-February 2022.\r\n\r\nA total of 39 cases were noted in all of Finland in February 2022, which is less than the 55 infections in February 2021. In February 2022, 5 cases of _Y. enterocolitica_ from South Savo were reported to the Infectious Diseases Register, which is run by THL, while from 2019 to 2021 there were no illnesses at the same time. THL does not routinely monitor the occurrence of _Yersinia_ infections, and strains isolated from patients are not routinely submitted to the agency's reference laboratory for typing.\r\n\r\nLocal food safety authorities report suspected foodborne outbreaks to the National Registry for Food and Waterborne Outbreaks, maintained by the Finnish Food Authority (Ruokavirasto) and THL. THL asked hospital and regional agencies to monitor the local situation and report suspected foodborne outbreaks. The agency also requested clinical laboratories to submit patient isolates related to outbreaks so they can be typed and to include _Y. enterocolitica_ serotype and biotype information, if available. Between 1995 and 2018, 13 344 _Y. enterocolitica_ cases were reported in Finland with an annual variation of 414 to 876 infections.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[The source or sources of the clusters of _Y. enterocolitica_ and whether the different clusters are related are not stated.\r\n\r\nThe 2 species of _Yersinia_ associated with foodborne disease are _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and _Y. enterocolitica_. The latter species can be associated with abdominal pain as a hallmark symptom. As a mesenteric lymphadenitis, yersiniosis can mimic appendicitis but may also cause infections of other sites, such as wounds, joints, and the urinary tract.\r\n\r\nAs noted in the FDA \"Bad Bug Book\" (<https://bit.ly/3pmDJN1>): \"Strains of _Y. enterocolitica_ can be found in meats (pork, beef, lamb, etc.), oysters, fish, and raw milk. The exact cause of the food contamination is unknown. However, the prevalence of this organism in soil, water, and animals, such as beavers, pigs, and squirrels, offers ample opportunities for it to enter our food supply. Poor sanitation and improper sterilization techniques by food handlers, including improper storage, cannot be overlooked as contributing to contamination.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition, some strains of these organisms can be associated with blood transfusion-associated illnesses due to an ability to grow at refrigerator temperatures. - Mod.LL\n\nProMED map:\nFinland: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701902,118>]\n\n[See Also:\nYersiniosis - Norway: undefined source 20210525.8381539\r\nYersiniosis - Sweden: imported iceberg lettuce, restaurant chain 20210323.8263943\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nYersiniosis - Norway (02): lettuce 20201227.8050413\r\nYersiniosis - Norway 20201226.8048354\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nYersiniosis - Denmark, Sweden: spinach, ex Italy 20190529.6492672\r\nYersiniosis - Denmark 20190503.6454286\r\nYersiniosis - Sweden 20190425.6440548\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nYersiniosis - Norway: undefined source 20180709.5895185\r\n2014\r\n----\r\nYersiniosis - New Zealand (04) 20141016.2870345\r\nYersiniosis - New Zealand: packaged carrots/lettuce susp. 20141008.2838748\r\nYersiniosis, campylobacteriosis - Finland: (US) raw milk 20140426.2430474\r\n2011\r\n----\r\nYersiniosis, pasteurized milk - USA (04): (PA) ice cream 20110828.2637\r\nYersiniosis, pasteurized milk - USA: (PA) 20110803.2345\r\nYersiniosis, lettuce - Norway (02): comment 20110411.1144\r\nYersiniosis, lettuce - Norway 20110409.1114]\n.................................................jh/ll/mj/jh"

Neurological experts who were not involved in the research said it was valuable and unique, but they cautioned that the implications of the changes were unclear and did not necessarily suggest that people might have lasting damage or that the changes might profoundly affect thinking, memory or other functions.\r\n\r\nThe study, involving people aged 51-81, found shrinkage and tissue damage primarily in brain areas related to sense of smell; some of those areas are also involved in other brain functions, the researchers said. \"To me, this is pretty convincing evidence that something changes in brains of this overall group of people with COVID,\" said Dr. Serena Spudich, chief of neurological infections and global neurology at the Yale School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study.\r\n\r\nBut, she cautioned: \"To make a conclusion that this has some long-term clinical implications for the patients I think is a stretch. We don't want to scare the public and have them think, 'Oh, this is proof that everyone's going to have brain damage and not be able to function.'\"\r\n\r\nThe study involved 785 participants in UK Biobank, a repository of medical and other data from about half a million people in Britain. The participants each underwent 2 brain scans roughly 3 years apart, plus some basic cognitive testing. In between their 2 scans, 401 participants tested positive for the coronavirus, all infected between March 2020 and April 2021. The other 384 participants formed a control group because they had not been infected with the coronavirus and had similar characteristics to the infected patients in areas like age, sex, medical history and socioeconomic status.\r\n\r\nWith normal aging, people lose a tiny fraction of gray matter each year. For example, in regions related to memory, the typical annual loss is between 0.2% and 0.3%, the researchers said.\r\n\r\nBut COVID patients in the study -- who underwent their 2nd brain scan an average of 4.5 months after their infection -- lost more than noninfected participants, experiencing between 0.2% and 2% additional gray matter loss in different brain regions over the 3 years between scans. They also lost more overall brain volume and showed more tissue damage in certain areas.\r\n\r\n\"I find it surprising in the sense of how much more was lost and how generalized it is,\" said Dr. Spudich, who has studied the neurological effects of COVID. She added, \"I wouldn't have expected to see quite so much percentage change.\"\r\n\r\nThe effects may be particularly notable because the study involved mostly people who -- like the majority of COVID patients in the general population -- were mildly affected by their initial COVID infection, not becoming sick enough to need hospitalization.\r\n\r\nThe study's lead author, Gwena\u00eblle Douaud, a professor in the department of clinical neurosciences at the University of Oxford, said that although the number of hospitalized patients in the study, 15, was too small to yield conclusive data, results suggested that their brain atrophy was worse than the mildly afflicted patients.\r\n\r\nPeople who had COVID also showed greater decline than uninfected people on a cognitive test related to attention and efficiency in performing a complex task. But outside experts and Dr. Douaud noted that the cognitive testing was rudimentary, so the study is very limited in what it can say about whether the gray matter loss and tissue damage the COVID patients experienced affected their cognitive skills.\r\n\r\n\"None of them got thorough enough cognitive testing to know if they had significant deficits in these many regions where they found these changes in volume,\" said Dr. Benedict Michael, an associate professor of neurological infections at the University of Liverpool, who is researching the neuropsychiatric effects of COVID and was not involved in the study. \"We don't know that it actually means anything for the patient's quality of life or function.\"\r\n\r\nFor example, although some of the largest gray matter loss was in areas related to smell, including the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus, those areas are also involved in memory and other functions. But the COVID patients did not perform worse than noninfected participants on memory tests, Dr. Douaud said, although she added that the memory tests they took were brief and basic.\r\n\r\nOutside experts and the study's authors said the range of brain areas where COVID patients experience more gray matter loss raised intriguing questions. \"There's no one part of the brain that does one thing,\" Dr. Douaud said. \"There are parts of the brain in the infected participants with additional gray matter loss that have nothing to do with the smell, and the ones that are related to smell also are involved in other brain functions.\"\r\n\r\nThe cause of the brain changes is unclear. The authors mentioned theories including inflammation, evidence of which has been found in other studies, and \"sensory deprivation\" from disrupted sense of smell.\r\n\r\nDr. Avindra Nath, chief of the section on infections of the nervous system at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, who was not involved in the study, said another \"critical question\" was whether the brain changes could make COVID patients more prone to dementia or other deficits in the future.\r\n\r\nAnd while the researchers did not find the same brain changes in patients with non-COVID pneumonia, Dr. Nath recommended studying patients with other coronaviruses or the flu \"to see if these findings are distinct for COVID-19 or more generalizable.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Spudich said the study's greatest value may be its indication that \"there's been something that's happened in the brain in these people,\" adding that \"I think people have felt that it's so vague, so hard to measure.\"\r\n\r\nOther scientists can now build on these findings, she and others said. \"It's an important study, they've done good work,\" Dr. Michael said, adding, \"now we need to do the studies to look at cognition and psychiatric symptoms and behavioral stuff and neurological stuff and find out what does this mean for patients.\"\r\n\r\n[Byline: Pam Belluck]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n[This study is a great start that raises concern, but more research needs to be done on long-term brain changes and associated behavioral and neurologic problems following infection, and following vaccination as well. - Mod.LK]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] Booster doses\r\nDate: Wed 2 Mar 2022\r\nSource: Medical News Today [edited]\r\n<https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/4th-shots-and-covid-19-boosters-why-and-when-best-to-get-it>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe emergence of the omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant has confirmed the need for vaccine boosters -- to combat waning immunity and provide more robust protection against severe disease and death. Several studies have shown that 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine do not provide enough protection against infection or severe disease from omicron. More and more evidence supports a 3-step approach, which might involve infection-plus-vaccination hybrid immunity or triple immunization [e.g., <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01715-4>].\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a growing number of countries are now exploring 2nd boosters -- or 4th doses -- as a way of effectively neutralizing omicron. Following in the footsteps of Israel, countries including Chile, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden are offering 4th doses to certain at-risk groups. In the United Kingdom, groups deemed most at risk are advised to have a 2nd booster shot this spring. Depending on the person, this could be a 4th or 5th dose.\r\n\r\nVariations in guidance have raised questions about who needs a 4th dose and what the most effective approach to immunity might be. Data about the need for a 4th dose, so far, [are] lacking, but recently published research indicates that it can restore waning immunity.\r\n\r\nA trial with the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines found that a 4th dose provided a modest boost in protection against omicron and restored antibodies to levels seen right after the 3rd dose. However, this did not translate into significantly increased effectiveness and did not prevent infection with omicron (<https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.15.22270948>).\r\n\r\nFour doses of the Pfizer vaccine were 30% more protective against infection than 3 doses. This extra protection was 11% for Moderna's vaccine.\r\n\r\nDr. William Haseltine, a scientist, public health expert, and president of ACCESS Health International, said initial studies showed that the 4th dose provided an additional boost in antibody levels. While not huge, this boost was \"measurable.\"\r\n\r\nThe additional dose could also reignite antibody production in the body when this begins to wane. According to a report by the UK Health Security Agency, the booster dose's capacity to protect against symptomatic infection drops to 45%-50% from 10 weeks onward (<https://bit.ly/36aeQQs>). Another UK analysis estimated that protection would drop to around 40% by the 4th month after the 3rd shot (<https://bit.ly/3hRwfzV>).\r\n\r\nThere is no hard evidence that a 4th dose is crucial, which means that it will likely be reserved for certain groups. Data suggest that it could benefit people with a high risk of severe illness and restore long-term protection.\r\n\r\nAn observational study from Israel showed that a 4th dose conferred slightly higher levels of protection against both infection and severe disease for those aged 60 or over and considered at risk. The additional dose was administered at least 4 months after the 3rd dose (<https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.01.22270232>).\r\n\r\nAlthough the increase in protection may seem minimal, experts believe that it could make a large difference for high-risk groups. Dr. Haseltine said that traditional risk groups, such as people with asthma, obesity, or immune suppression, could benefit from a 4th dose.\r\n\r\nThe biggest argument against boosters is that COVID-19 vaccines offer less protection against omicron than they did against variants such as delta or alpha. While the effectiveness against infection is reduced, recent evidence shows that 3 doses are 99% effective at preventing hospitalization and severe disease across all populations.\r\n\r\n\"With omicron, it's clear that 2 doses aren't enough, and 3 doses are needed if you are going to have any protection at all,\" Dr. Haseltine told Medical News Today (MNT). There is also growing evidence that unvaccinated individuals with past SARS-CoV-2 infections are vulnerable to reinfection by both current and future variants. This is especially true for the delta and omicron variants.\r\n\r\nResearch shows that a past omicron infection does not protect against infections with other SARS-CoV-2 variants in people who have not been vaccinated (<https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.10.22270789>). In the study, people who had been vaccinated then developed breakthrough infections not only had better humoral immune responses but also had cross-protective immunity to the delta and beta variants.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, having COVID-19, then receiving 3 doses of the vaccine increased protection to 71% from 44% for the unvaccinated with prior infections, according to the SIREN study (<https://bit.ly/3hRLitt>).\r\n\r\nHaving a booster too soon or too late after the primary series is another point of contention. A study conducted in Japan found that having a breakthrough infection shortly after vaccination did not boost antibodies by much. However, having an infection months after the last dose significantly increased protection, particularly against omicron (<https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.28.21268481>).\r\n\r\n\"We do see that antibodies begin to wane after 3 months,\" said Dr. Alexander Rodgers, an associate program director at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science. Most countries offering the additional booster have adopted this time frame.\r\n\r\n\"If you're a person that is at higher risk, mostly because of your age or other factors, I'd recommend the 4th after 3 or 4 months. The reason for that is we know that the protective antibodies tend to wane pretty rapidly after 3-4 months,\" said Dr. Haseltine. He said that for those at higher risk who may not have produced sufficient antibodies, he would recommend \"a shorter rather than longer interval: 3-4 months rather than 6 months or longer.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Rodgers pointed out that optimizing the interval for antibody efficiency may be a more viable strategy for most countries. \"If you're in a country that has not yet approved the 4th dose, then it would be reasonable to try and push that 3rd dose to the point of maximum efficiency of that 2nd dose,\" he told MNT. \"That's why I think there's that variability -- because countries are just trying to pick an arbitrary line in the sand with the best research and evidence that they have and be mindful of the resources that they have,\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"Right now, 3 vs 4 vs 5 or even 6 [doses] more speaks to a country's vaccine allocation and resources than it does to any hard evidence,\" said Dr. Rodgers. He pointed out that more studies were needed to determine the optimal interval and number of doses.\r\n\r\nWith the prospect of multiple boosters, peak immunity or an immunity threshold may also be possible. Research from China, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, suggested that immune response to COVID-19 could not be endlessly boosted, and there would be a \"turning point\" (<https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.19.22271215>).\r\n\r\nThere is also the issue of resource utilization and vaccine inequity. \"When we're thinking about the vaccine program, we're really trying to reach maximum efficiency. I think that there are 2 types of efficiency, for the individual and from a global public health standpoint. From a global standpoint, the most important risk factors are preventing hospitalization and death,\" said Dr. Rodgers.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to 2 strategies: having some countries begin to administer 4th doses or acknowledging that this is a pandemic and focusing on getting 1st and 2nd doses to large swaths of populations that have not yet had them. \"Although the 3rd and 4th doses do decrease the risk of hospitalization and death, the most dramatic improvement is after completing the initial 2 doses. The current vaccines are still effective in protecting against hospitalization and death -- the 2 major points of concern.\"\r\n\r\nThe need for annual boosters will depend on how future variants differ from the initial strain, said Dr. Rodgers. \"In the United States, the coronavirus is demonstrating this type of seasonality where our biggest waves are in the winter, similar to other cold and flu seasons. I wouldn't be surprised if annual boosting or annual vaccine programs like for the flu become a common practice,\" he said.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Yasemin Nicola Sakay]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nClaudinne Miller\r\nTulane Outbreak News\r\n<cmiller15@tulane.edu>\r\n\r\n[\"Pfizer Inc. will soon submit data to US regulators on a 4th dose of its COVID-19 vaccine, Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said.

And, in the United States, weekly pediatric COVID-19 cases dropped below 100 000, part of a 6-week decline from the omicron peak in children.\r\n\r\nIn a statement, the WHO expert group said it strongly recommends the current vaccines and boosters because they continue to provide high levels of protection against severe disease and death, even against the backdrop of omicron spread. However, they said to optimize protection in the future, different approaches may be needed, such as monovalent versions that target a specific variant or a polyvalent vaccine that protects against multiple ones.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year [2022], Moderna and Pfizer announced the start of clinical trials to test omicron-specific vaccines. Also, testing is underway in Israel to assess the effectiveness of a 4th dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine against the omicron variant.\r\n\r\nIdeally, future vaccines would limit transmission as well as cut infections and deaths, the group said. And though pansarbecovirus vaccines and vaccines that prompt mucosal immunity might be useful, they added that timeframes for development and production are uncertain.\r\n\r\nThey urged vaccine makers to keep tracking vaccine performance of current vaccines and those being developed against specific variants and to share the data with WHO technical advisors so that the group can consider whether any vaccine strain adjustments are needed.\r\n\r\nThe group's statement on COVID-19 vaccine composition is its second and follows its initial recommendations in January of this year [2022].\r\n\r\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n\r\n----\r\n[B] Hong Kong, Korea, New Zealand: hotspots\r\nDate: Tue 8 Mar 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/who-lays-out-plan-covid-vaccines-tackle-new-variants>\r\n\r\n\r\nHong Kong reported more than 43 000 new cases today [8 Mar 2022], as mainland officials pushed for leaders to maintain a \"dynamic zero\" strategy, according to Reuters (<https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-hong-kongs-priority-is-cut-covid-infections-deaths-2022-03-08/>).

Some strains could result in severe diseases in humans, such as hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, which may cause diarrhea, vomiting, renal failure, and even death.\r\n\r\nPeople are advised to sanitize their living environment and storage facilities with a diluted bleach solution to prevent the spread of the disease.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Huang Tzu-ti]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\r\nand\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this report.\r\n\r\nAs noted earlier, Taiwan has had sporadic cases of hantavirus infections in recent years, with the Taiwan CDC indicating that there were 10 cases last year (2021). The case above is the 1st diagnosed for 2022.\r\n\r\nThe hantavirus involved is not stated, nor is the species of rodent identified. However, the mention that the horse ranch has rats leads one to suspect Seoul hantavirus, assuming that the rat involved was a brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), the natural host of this virus.\r\n\r\nIn Asia, the 5 recognized hantaviruses, with their main rodent reservoir species, are Hantaan virus (_Apodemus agrarius_), Amur virus (_A. peninsulae_), Thailand virus (_Bandicota indica_), Seoul virus (widely distributed worldwide in the brown rat, _R. norvegicus_), and Muju virus (_Myodes regulus_). Hantaan virus and Seoul virus cause cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) frequently in Asia. People become infected when exposed to the virus in excreta (urine, saliva, and feces) of infected rats. It is not necessary to have contact with liquid urine; dust particles contaminated with dried urine may be inhaled. Transmission can also occur by rat bite.\r\n\r\nAn image of the brown rat, _R. norvegicus_, a reservoir of Seoul virus, can be seen at <http://www.discoverlife.org/im/I_RB/0000/320/Rattus_norvegicus,I_RB27.jpg>. - Mod.TY\r\n\r\nProMED map of Taiwan: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701907,193>]\n\n[See Also:\n2021\r\n----\r\nHantavirus - Asia (02): Taiwan 20211130.8699962\r\nHantavirus - Asia: Taiwan 20210815.8597432\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nHantavirus - Asia (04): Taiwan 20200625.7507236\r\nHantavirus - Asia (03): Taiwan 20200616.7472861\r\nHantavirus - Asia (02): Taiwan 20200507.7308285\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nHantavirus - Asia: Taiwan 20190828.6646313\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nHantavirus - Asia: Taiwan 20180410.5736720\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nHantavirus - Asia (03): Taiwan 20170117.4770058\r\n2016\r\n----\r\nHantavirus update - Asia (03): Taiwan (KH) 20160426.4185299\r\n2015\r\n----\r\nHantavirus update - Asia (01): Taiwan 20150112.3085577]\n.................................................sb/jh/ty/tw/jh"

The disease has spread since then. In 2019, it had been associated with _Lasiodiplodia_ sp. based mainly on morphology, with _Hylocereus_ as a new host for this genus. A molecular study had to be carried out to confirm the causal agent to species level, as well as determine its phylogeny, epidemiology, and host range.\r\n\r\nOf 8 fungal isolates from symptomatic dragon fruit stems, 2 were analysed by morphology, as well as phylogeny of sequence data from 3 different genomic regions. They were identified as _Lasiodiplodia theobromae_. Inoculation trials on dragon fruit stems confirmed Koch's postulate. The isolates were also found pathogenic on mango, guava, banana, and _H. polyrhizus_ fruits.\r\n\r\nThe data will contribute to understanding the biology of _L. theobromae_ as a newly recognised pathogen of dragon fruit, as well as help to design effective management strategies against this pathogen.\r\n\r\n[Source publication: <https://doi.org/10.1002/jobm.202100501> or <https://bit.ly/3MEKZjC>]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Dragon fruit (also called pitaya, strawberry pear) is the common name for several cactus species and hybrids, mostly of the genus _Hylocereus_, but also _Stenocereus_ and some other related genera. These vine-like epiphytic cacti originate in Central and South America but are also widely grown in Southeast Asia. They are an important fruit crop in these regions because of their high nutritional value. Several varieties with varying skin and pulp colours are planted commercially. Few pathogens are known to affect the crops, but disease management is especially difficult since dragon fruit is propagated by cuttings, which may spread any pathogens.\r\n\r\nThe fungus _Lasiodiplodia theobromae_ was first reported in Cameroon in 1895 associated with charcoal pod rot of cocoa. Subsequently it was found to have a wide host range of more than 280 species including many crops such as citrus, grapevine, vegetable hosts, strawberry, sweet potato, and mango. Depending on the host, symptoms may include wilting, fruit rots, dieback, vascular discolouration, complete defoliation, and death of plants. It is thought that nutrient deficiencies and environmental stress factors may enhance the susceptibility of some hosts. Fungicides may be helpful in disease management if applied quickly enough. An increase in virulence has been reported on some hosts, suggesting that new strains of the fungus may be emerging in different areas.\r\n\r\nMaps\r\nBangladesh:\r\n<http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/bangladesh_map.jpg> and\r\n<http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OvthAOOs_tE/T6qxrewlF8I/AAAAAAAAAKw/Qg1nYXeyA9A/s1600/BangladeshDistrictsMap.JPG>\r\n\r\nPictures\r\n_L. theobromae_ symptoms on different hosts:\r\n<https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780124115521000107-f10-02-9780124115521.jpg>,\r\n<https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Papaya_%28Carica_papaya%29_Lasiodiplodia_fruit_rot.jpg/640px-Papaya_%28Carica_papaya%29_Lasiodiplodia_fruit_rot.jpg>,\r\n<https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/ad709408b105f46db97bcf400d115ab8bc8fb0ce/10-Figure6-1.png>,\r\n<https://bugwoodcloud.org/images/768x512/1577563.jpg> and via\r\n<https://www.insectimages.org/browse/taxthumb.cfm?fam=68&genus=Lasiodiplodia>\r\nHealthy dragon fruit and plants:\r\n<https://4.imimg.com/data4/OG/AQ/MY-24448511/dragon-fruit-500x500.jpg> and\r\n<https://fairdinkumseeds.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dragonfruit1.jpg>\r\n\r\nLinks\r\nFirst detection of dragon fruit stem canker in Bangladesh:\r\n<https://doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-03-19-0619-PDN>\r\nInformation on _L. theobromae_ and associated diseases on different hosts:\r\n<https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/40844>,\r\n<http://www.mycobank.org/name/Lasiodiplodia%20theobromae>,\r\n<https://doi.org/10.5941/MYCO.2016.44.4.319>,\r\n<http://www.westerdijkinstitute.nl/images/ResearchGroups/Phytopathology/pdf/Lasiodiplodia.pdf>,\r\n<https://doi.org/10.1007/s10658-014-0557-8>,\r\n<https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00829>,\r\n<https://doi.org/10.5943/PPQ/7/2/14> and\r\n<https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-411552-1.00010-7>\r\n_L. theobromae_ taxonomy and synonyms:\r\n<http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=188476> and\r\n<http://www.speciesfungorum.org/GSD/GSDspecies.asp?RecordID=188476>\r\nInformation on dragon fruit cultivation and diseases:\r\n<http://tastylandscape.com/2015/09/05/dragon-fruit-diseases/> (with pictures),\r\n<https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/62b9/eca25787471c4a04e266c03eb2a4caa0de22.pdf>,\r\n<https://tinyurl.com/yabd8nz8>,\r\n<https://tinyurl.com/y87zkqjp>,\r\n<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288380543_Fungi_on_Dragon_Fruit_in_Loei_Province_Thailand_and_the_Ability_of_Bipolaris_cactivora_to_Cause_Post-harvest_Fruit_Rot> and\r\n<http://www.academia.edu/11505782/Disease_on_Dragon_Fruits_Hylocereus_sp._>\r\n- Mod.DHA]\n\n[See Also:\n2021\r\n----\r\nLasiodiplodia dieback, almond - Turkey: 1st rep (SU) 20211208.8700135\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nLasiodiplodia dieback, blueberry - Europe: 1st rep (Spain) 20190912.6671449\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nUndiagnosed diseases, dragon fruit - Viet Nam: (BU) 20181008.6078619\r\n2010\r\n----\r\nSudden decline, mango - multicountry: update 20101104.3990\r\nSudden decline, mango - United Arab Emirates 20100214.0524\r\n2009\r\n----\r\nSudden decline, mango - Oman 20091214.4240\r\nLasiodiplodia dieback, cocoa - India: 1st rep (KA) 20090814.2892\r\nDothiorella blight, dragon fruit - Malaysia: spread 20090612.2170\r\n2008\r\n----\r\nFungal diseases, mango - Australia, Pakistan 20080229.0832\r\n2005\r\n----\r\nFruit spot, eggplant - USA (GA) 20050817.2403]\n.................................................sb/dha/tw/jh"

Ten cases were detected in Winneshiek County and 2 in Fayette County in 2019.\r\n\r\nHarms says, overall for the state there's been a 2% prevalence rate of CWD out of the 5000 samples, which is about what the DNR expected. He adds the goal is to keep that prevalence as low as possible.\r\n\r\nHarms encourages deer hunters to keep hunting and keep submitting samples for testing and to properly dispose of the deer carcasses to help prevent the spread of the disease. He adds that the general public can also help by not putting out feed for deer, noting that CWD is spread via direct contact between individual animals.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Mark Pitz]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[ProMED map of Iowa, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701909,218>]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] Mississippi (Warren County): deer\r\nDate: Sun 2 Jan 2022\r\nSource: Magnolia State Live [edited]\r\n<https://www.magnoliastatelive.com/2022/01/02/deer-found-in-mississippi-tests-positive-for-chronic-wasting-disease/>\r\n\r\n\r\nA deer found in Warren County has tested positive for chronic wasting disease, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks [MDWFP] announced Thursday [30 Dec 2021].\r\n\r\nThe mature buck was reported to MDWFP in mid-December [2021] as potentially diseased given its drastically emaciated and lethargic condition.

In Virginia, a total of 134 deer from 11 counties have tested positive for the disease since 2009.\r\n\r\nThis incurable disease, found in deer, elk, and moose in North America, is a slow and progressive neurologic disease ultimately resulting in death of the animal. The disease-causing agent is spread through the urine, feces, and saliva of infected animals.\r\n\r\nIn CWD Disease Management (DMA) Area 3, which comprises Floyd, Montgomery, and Pulaski counties, of the 1259 deer tested, 2 tested positive for the disease: one in Montgomery County and the other in Floyd County.\r\n\r\nA 3rd deer, sampled by a cooperator located in DMA3, was determined to be infected with CWD; however, the location of harvest for this animal was not able to be confirmed.\r\n\r\nBecause of the new CWD detection in Floyd County, the Department of Wildlife Resources is expanding that DMA to include Carroll County.\r\n\r\nOfficials said the diseased deer found in Floyd County was about 5 mi [8 km] from the 2020 Montgomery County detection, and less than 10 mi [16 km] from Carroll County.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Jeff Williamson]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\r\n\r\n[ProMED map of Floyd County, Virginia, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701909,22874>]\n\n[\"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal, neurological illness occurring in North American cervids (members of the deer family), including white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and moose. Since its discovery in 1967, CWD has spread geographically and increased in prevalence locally. CWD is contagious; it can be transmitted freely within and among cervid populations. No treatments or vaccines are currently available.\r\n\r\n\"Chronic wasting disease is of great concern to wildlife managers. It has been detected in at least 23 states, 2 Canadian provinces, and South Korea.

Deaths also fell, declining by 8%.\r\n\r\nMore than 10 million cases were reported to the WHO last week, with South Korea, Germany, Viet Nam, Russia, and Japan reporting the most. There were more than 52 000 new deaths, and the United States continues to report the most COVID-19 fatalities of any country.\r\n\r\nIn the WHO's Western Pacific region, rising cases were driven by surges in South Korea, Hong Kong, Viet Nam, and New Zealand. South Korea today [9 Mar 2022] reported a new record high, with 342 466 new cases, as did Hong Kong, with 58 757 new cases. Elsewhere, China's cases reached a new 2-year high, with 555 new cases, and health officials in Shanghai are battling an uptick in asymptomatic cases by doing mass testing, delaying some large gatherings and shutting some public spaces, according to Reuters (<https://news.yahoo.com/shanghai-steps-defences-against-wave-070017082.html>).\r\n\r\nOf sequenced samples over the past month, 99.7% were the omicron variant, and, of those, 34.2% were the more transmissible BA.2 omicron subvariant. The WHO said its technical advisory group is aware of reports of recombinants of delta and omicron and of BA.1 and BA.2, which it said isn't surprising.\r\n\r\nSo far, however, sequencing hasn't identified any signs of rapid transmission or changes in illness severity. And only a few recombinant clusters have been reported, with little sign of spread.\r\n\r\nAt a briefing today [9 Mar 2022], WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said though cases and deaths are declining and countries are loosening restrictions, the pandemic is far from over. \"The virus continues to evolve, and we continue to face major obstacles in distributing vaccines, tests, and treatments everywhere they are needed,\" he said (<https://bit.ly/3i2uvUw>).\r\n\r\nTedros also said the WHO is concerned that several countries have drastically reduced testing, which he says clouds the ability to see where the virus is, how it's spreading, and how it's evolving.\r\n\r\nIn a related development today [9 Mar 2022], the WHO posted interim guidance on the use of rapid tests, which it says should be offered as part of overall COVID-19 testing services. The guidance addresses implementation considerations, including prioritizing populations, test accessibility, and reporting (<https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Ag-RDTs-Self_testing-2022.1>).\r\n\r\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n----\r\n[B] Hawaii: mask mandate\r\nDate: Wed 9 Mar 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/global-drop-covid-19-continues-cases-still-high>\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday [8 Mar 2022] Hawaii became the final US state to announce that indoor mask requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic will end; the step takes effect on 26 Mar 2022. Puerto Rico announced earlier this week that all mask mandates on the island would be ending this week [10 Mar 2022].\r\n\r\nNew cases of COVID-19 continue to drop across the country. The United States reported 29 805 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [8 Mar 2022] and 1532 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker (<https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases>). The 7-day average of new daily cases is 38 239, with 1398 daily deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker (<https://wapo.st/3w3Z0l5>). In total, the country has seen 79 385 516 COVID-19 cases in the past 2 years, including 963 079 deaths.\r\n\r\nWidespread infection with the omicron variant and vaccination has helped raised immunity in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID Data Tracker shows 65.1% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 76.6% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 44.1% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose (<https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total>).\r\n\r\nAs the country moves on to the next phase of the pandemic, both the White House and public health experts are touting a test-to-treat program that pairs positive COVID-19 tests with antiviral drugs. Pfizer today [9 Mar 2022] launched a phase 2/3 study of its approved antiviral, Paxlovid, in kids ages 6-17.\r\n\r\n\"There is a significant unmet need for outpatient treatments that can be taken by children and adolescents to help prevent progression to severe illness, including hospitalization or death,\" said Mikael Dolsten, chief scientific officer and president of worldwide research, development and medical at Pfizer in a press release (<https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-initiates-phase-23-study-novel-covid-19-oral>).\r\n\r\n\"Paxlovid is already authorized or approved in many countries around the world, with more than 1.5 million treatment courses delivered thus far and 30 million expected by July [2022] to help combat this devastating disease.\"\r\n\r\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] USA: deaths\r\nDate: Tue 8 Mar 2022 16:03 EST\r\nSource: The Atlantic [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/03/covid-us-death-rate/626972/>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States reported more deaths from COVID-19 last Friday [4 Mar 2022] than deaths from Hurricane Katrina, more on any 2 recent weekdays than deaths during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, more last month [February 2022] than deaths from flu in a bad season, and more in 2 years than deaths from HIV during the 4 decades of the AIDS epidemic. At least 953 000 Americans have died from COVID, and the true toll is likely even higher because many deaths went uncounted. COVID is now the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States, after only heart disease and cancer, which are both catchall terms for many distinct diseases. The sheer scale of the tragedy strains the moral imagination. On 24 May 2020, as the United States passed 100 000 recorded deaths, The New York Times filled its front page with the names of the dead, describing their loss as \"incalculable.\" Now the nation hurtles toward a milestone of one million. What is 10 times incalculable?\r\n\r\nMany countries have been pummeled by the coronavirus, but few have fared as poorly as the United States. Its death rate surpassed that of any other large, wealthy nation -- especially during the recent omicron surge. The Biden administration placed all its bets on a vaccine-focused strategy, rather than the multilayered protections that many experts called for, even as America lagged behind other wealthy countries in vaccinating (and boosting) its citizens -- especially elderly people, who are most vulnerable to the virus. In a study of 29 high-income countries, the United States experienced the largest decline in life expectancy in 2020 and, unlike much of Europe, did not bounce back in 2021. It was also the only country whose lowered life span was driven mainly by deaths among people under 60. Dying from COVID robbed each American of about a decade of life on average. As a whole, US life expectancy fell by 2 years -- the largest such decline in almost a century. Neither World War II nor any of the flu pandemics that followed it dented American longevity so badly.\r\n\r\nEvery American who died of COVID left an average of 9 close relatives bereaved. Roughly 9 million people -- 3% of the population -- now have a permanent hole in their world that was once filled by a parent, child, sibling, spouse, or grandparent. An estimated 149 000 children have lost a parent or caregiver. Many people were denied the familiar rituals of mourning -- bedside goodbyes, in-person funerals. Others are grieving raw and recent losses, their grief trampled amid the stampede toward normal.\r\n\r\nAfter many of the biggest disasters in American memory, including 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, \"it felt like the world stopped,\" Lori Peek, a sociologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder who studies disasters, told me. \"On some level, we owned our failures, and there were real changes.\" Crossing one million deaths could offer a similar opportunity to take stock, but \"900 000 deaths felt like a big threshold to me, and we didn't pause,\" Peek said. Why is that? Why were so many publications and politicians focused on reopenings in January and February [2022] -- the 4th- and 5th-deadliest months of the pandemic? Why did the CDC issue new guidelines that allowed most Americans to dispense with indoor masking when at least 1000 people had been dying of COVID every day for almost 6 straight months? If the United States faced half a year of daily hurricanes that each took 1000 lives, it is hard to imagine that the nation would decide to, quite literally, throw caution to the wind. Why, then, is COVID different?\r\n\r\nMany aspects of the pandemic work against a social reckoning. The threat -- a virus -- is invisible, and the damage it inflicts is hidden from public view. With no lapping floodwaters or smoking buildings, the tragedy becomes contestable to a degree that a natural disaster or terrorist attack cannot be. Meanwhile, many of those who witnessed COVID's ruin are in no position to discuss it. Healthcare workers are still reeling from \"death on a scale I had never seen before,\" as an intensive-care nurse told me last year [2021]. The bereaved face guilt on top of sadness: \"I think about the way it would run through families and tight-knit groups and the huge psychological toll as people think, Am I the one who brought it in?\" Whitney Robinson, a social epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told me. And though 3% of Americans have lost a close family member to COVID, that means 97% have not. The 2 years that were shaved off of the average life span undid 2 decades of progress in health, but in 2000, \"it didn't feel like we were living under a horrible mortality regime,\" Andrew Noymer, a demographer at UC Irvine, told me. \"It felt normal.\"\r\n\r\nNo one knows how many people will die from COVID in the coming years. The number will depend on our collective behavior, how many more people can be vaccinated or boosted, the length and strength of immunity, what new variants arise, and more. Andrew Noymer, the demographer, thinks that COVID will kill fewer people per year than it has in the past 2, but will probably still be more lethal than the flu, which sets a plausible and very wide range of somewhere between 50 000 and 500 000 annual deaths. (COVID will also continue to cause long-term disability.)\r\n\r\nHow much of this extra mortality will the United States accept? The CDC's new guidelines provide a clue. They recommend that protective measures such as indoor masking kick in once communities pass certain thresholds of cases and hospitalizations. But the health-policy experts Joshua Salomon and Alyssa Bilinski calculated that by the time communities hit the CDC's thresholds, they'd be on the path to at least 3 daily deaths per million, which equates to 1000 deaths per day nationally. And crucially, the warning lights would go off too late to prevent those deaths. \"As a level of mortality the White House and CDC are willing to accept before calling for more public health protection, this is heartbreaking,\" Salomon said on Twitter.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Ed Yong]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nClaudinne Miller\r\nTulane Outbreak News\r\n<cmiller15@tulane.edu>\r\n\r\n[An interesting perspective on the public's reaction to COVID case counts and deaths worth reading in full. - Mod.LK]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] CIDRAP News\r\n[A] UK: BA.2\r\nDate: Thu 10 Mar 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/covid-19-remains-high-uk-ba2-gains-ground>\r\n\r\n\r\nAn ongoing swab testing study that's been underway for the last 2 years to monitor COVID-19 spread in the United Kingdom revealed that, although cases are declining, they remain at a high level, with signs of a potential increase in older age-groups. The UK REACT study, done by a research team based at Imperial College London, has been tracking disease levels with swab tests.\r\n\r\nPublic health officials have urged countries to continue population monitoring for COVID-19 to assess who is getting infected and where the virus is spreading. Also, health officials closely watch patterns in Britain and other European countries because their COVID-19 trends have been a harbinger of how outbreaks could unfold elsewhere, including in the United States.\r\n\r\nFor the latest study, the group analyzed the results of nearly 95 000 swab tests that were conducted across the country from 8 Feb to 1 Mar 2022 (<https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/95323/2/REACT_R18_and_SI.pdf>). Since the last report that covered roughly January [2022], prevalence of COVID-19 dropped from 4.41% to 2.88%. The researchers noted, however, that, at 2.88%, prevalence is still high -- at the 2nd-highest level since the study began in March 2020.\r\n\r\nTheir analysis of genetic sequences from 1195 samples showed that all but one was the omicron variant, and, as of 21 Feb 2022, they estimate that nearly half (47.2%) were the BA.2 subvariant, which is more transmissible than the parent omicron virus. In their last report, released in late January [2022], they found that only 6 sequences were BA.2 (<https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/233381/fall-coronavirus-infections-england-have-stalled/>).\r\n\r\nInfection rates varied by age and region, and the team noted that levels were flat or possibly rising in people ages 55 and older. Also, the team saw high infection rates in London, followed by the southwest.\r\n\r\nJenny Harries, MD, chief executive of the UK's Health Security Agency, said in a statement that the data confirm that cases have declined since the omicron peak. \"However, the increasing presence of the BA.2 sub-lineage of omicron and the recent slight increase in infections in those over 55 shows that the pandemic is not over and that we can expect to see COVID-19 circulating at high levels.\"\r\n\r\nPaul Elliott, MBBS, PhD, who directs the REACT program at Imperial College London, said the possibility that infections are rising in older adults indicates that a high number of infections will lead to more illnesses, even though the group is highly vaccinated. \"So it's important that people continue to follow public health guidance to avoid fueling further spread of the virus.\"\r\n\r\nSurges continue in omicron hot spots: Hong Kong leaders appear to be stepping back from mass testing as part of handling its surge of cases, with more than 31 402 cases and 180 deaths reported today [10 Mar 2022]. Chief Executive Carrie Lam today said Hong Kong won't lift its ban on flights from 9 countries and reopen the city until its surge is under control, according to Reuters (<https://reut.rs/3t2mNjl>).\r\n\r\nChina's rise in COVID-19 activity continues, with 402 more local symptomatic cases reported as well as 435 more local asymptomatic infections, according to the National Health Commission. The largest portion were from Jilin province, which had 165 of the symptomatic cases and 179 of the asymptomatic cases (<http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2022-03/10/c_85882.htm>).\r\n\r\nIn Germany, cases topped 250 000 for the 1st time during the pandemic, according to Deutsche Welle, which said the coalition government has settled on new COVID measures to replace ones that expire on 19 Mar 2022. The new ones include basic steps such as masking on public transport and limiting regular testing to nursing homes and other vulnerable settings, though states can institute other measures if they experience future spikes (<https://www.dw.com/en/germany-new-daily-covid-19-infections-pass-250000-for-first-time/a-61075687>).\r\n\r\nNew Zealand, which is experiencing its worst surge, is feeling COVID-19 pressure on doctor's offices and hospitals, according to Radio New Zealand, which said general practice clinic workload has increased 50% and patient loads at Auckland hospitals are already above their worst-case scenarios (<https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/463054/watch-live-covid-19-briefing-it-is-still-going-to-be-messy-for-the-next-couple-of-weeks>).\r\n\r\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n\r\n----\r\n[B] USA: coronavirus package\r\nDate: Thu 10 Mar 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/covid-19-remains-high-uk-ba2-gains-ground>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives failed to include a USD 15 billion coronavirus pandemic package when it approved a USD 1.5 trillion spending bill yesterday [9 Mar 2022], signaling a major setback for the Biden administration. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said a separate COVID relief bill will be introduced, The Hill reports (<https://thehill.com/homenews/house/597589-pelosi-says-separate-coronavirus-relief-bill-will-be-put-on-the-floor>).\r\n\r\nFor weeks the administration has petitioned lawmakers to increase funding for pandemic-related relief packages, but the war in Ukraine and plummeting case counts have pushed the pandemic to the political back burner. The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 37 685, with 1369 daily deaths, according to The New York Times tracker (<https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html>).\r\n\r\nIn related news, a new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) shows that 40% to 60% of Americans missed work during the omicron surge, and 6 of 10 Americans who earn USD 40 000 or less a year reported missing work owing to the most recent surge of the virus. Twenty percent of those polled said missing work had a significant impact on family finances.\r\n\r\nAs the nation enters the 3rd year of the pandemic, many companies continue to change pandemic policies. United Airlines, one of the 1st major companies to announce vaccine mandates last summer [2021], announced it will allow workers who haven't been vaccinated against COVID-19 for religious or medical reasons to return at the end of the month [March 2022], the Wall Street Journal reports (<https://on.wsj.com/3tSo6AC>).\r\n\r\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n\r\n******\r\n[4] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 10 Mar 2022)\r\nDate: Thu 10 Mar 2022\r\nSource: WHO [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://covid19.who.int/table>\r\n\r\n\r\n*Daily case reports as of 10 Mar 2022 16:48 CET\r\n\r\nSurveillance\r\n------------\r\nWHO region (no. countries/territories):\r\nTotal confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWestern Pacific Region (19): 30 049 923 (789 738) / 190 747 (1091)\r\nEuropean Region (61): 185 513 805 (800 258) / 1 897 675 (2392)\r\nSouth-East Asia Region (10): 56 335 465 (48 894) / 767 622 (456)\r\nEastern Mediterranean Region (22): 21 375 560 (12 670) / 337 612 (255)\r\nRegion of the Americas (54): 148 475 359 (147 136) / 2 654 909 (2865)\r\nAfrican Region (49): 8 478 759 (18 229) / 170 507 (104)\r\nCases on an international conveyance: 764 (0) / 13 (0)\r\n\r\nConfirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\r\nGrand total: 450 229 635 (1 816 925) / 6 019 085 (7163)\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[Data by country, area, or territory for 10 Mar 2022 can be accessed at <https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WHO%20Data%20Tables%20MAR10_1647026659.pdf>.\r\n\r\n- The Americas region reported 8.0% of cases and 39.9% of deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported more than 148.47 million cases, 2nd to the European region as the most severely affected region.

The information was released by the municipality on Tuesday [22 Feb 2022]. In December of last year [2021], the City Hall also carried out the vaccine blockade in the region of Moreeiras, for the same reason.\r\n\r\nThe cattle testing positive for rabies was located in the community of Basilio, in the district of Areado, which is about 40 km [25 mi] from the city. The mobilization, which is called anti-rabies blockade, involved domestic animals within a 5 km [3 mi] radius of the place.\r\n\r\nIn all, 326 dogs and 111 cats were vaccinated. Part of them already received the vaccine in 2021, but were revaccinated according to the guidance of the competent state bodies. The city took the opportunity to guide the population on the importance of immunizing animals and ways of transmitting and preventing the disease.\r\n\r\n\"It is important to highlight that the vaccination of cattle and horses against rabies has become mandatory, on behalf of the owner of the animals, although the declaration to the Mineiro de Agropecu\u00e1ria Institute (IMA) is not mandatory. Anyway, this will help a lot to avoid occurrences like this\", explains the director of Health Surveillance in the city, L\u00edlian Marinho.\r\n\r\nThe professional also says the vaccination blockade of dogs and cats is a way to eliminate one of the cycles of transmission of the disease, since, if an animal was detected with rabies, it is because there are bats infected with the virus in the region and that could infect other mammals.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Patos de Minas City Hall, rabies is transmitted by bats feeding on blood, the so-called hematophagous bats. [This is likely the species more commonly known as the vampire bat. - Mod.TG]\r\n\r\nWith the virus present in saliva, it transmits the disease by sucking or licking blood from mammals, such as horses, cattle, dogs and cats. Therefore, domestic animals are the main transmission agents for humans. [If this is the vampire bat, it most likely makes a tiny razor-like cut in the skin and then licks the blood from the wound. These bats are known to feed on cattle and horses, especially at night. - Mod.TG]\r\n\r\n\"Rabies is a serious disease, with a lethality rate close to 100%.

It was lying in the parking area of an industrial park at 301 Lincoln Ave., officials said.\r\n\r\n\"It is important these children be seen by a health care provider because of the potential for a serious health issue,\" county Public Health Officer Dr. Geoffrey Leung said.\r\n \r\nThe bat was confirmed to have been a carrier of rabies following tests at a county lab, he said.\r\n \r\nRabies impacts the central nervous system and is transmitted through saliva of a wild animal. Humans can be exposed if they're bitten, or if the saliva otherwise enters a break in a person's skin, according to the California Department of Public Health.\r\n \r\nA rabies vaccine is available, but if it is not administered in time, \"there is no effective treatment, and the infected person will likely die within a few days,\" CDPH said.\r\n \r\nAnyone with concerns about exposure risks was encouraged to contact the county health department at 951-358-5107.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED HealthMap Alerts\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] USA: Florida (Polk County) bat, dog\r\nDate: Thu 3 Mar 2022\r\nSource: WFTV \r\n<https://bit.ly/3KBFQaq>\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimal Control officials have confirmed the 1st case of rabies this year [2022] in Polk County.\r\n \r\nOfficials said a bat had tested positive for the deadly virus on [3 Mar 2022].\r\n \r\nAccording to the Polk County Sheriff's Office Animal Control Section, a family dog in the Lake Mirror area of Winter Haven was found with a live bat in its mouth on [1 Mar 2022].\r\n \r\nThe family contacted Animal Control which then sent the bat to a Tampa lab for testing.\r\n\r\nOfficials say the dog was current on its rabies vaccination, but will still need to be quarantined to make sure it is not infected. [Although the dog is current on its rabies vaccination, it is recommended by the rabies compendium to revaccinate immediately and then placed under a 45-day quarantine, instead of a 4-month quarantine. The compendium implies this quarantine may be a home quarantine provided certain qualifications are met. - Mod.TG] \r\n \r\nPolk County had 5 confirmed cases of rabies in 2021, and 2 in 2020.\r\n \r\nOfficials warn residents if a wild mammal is acting aggressive or appears sick to stay away and contact Animal Control immediately.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Matt Reeser]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n \r\n******\r\n[4] USA: Florida (Hillsborough County) cat, human exposure\r\nDate: Tue 8 Mar 2022\r\nSource: Bay News 9 [edited]\r\n<https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2022/03/08/rabies-alert-east-bank-drive-tampa>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Florida Department of Health in Hillsborough County has issued a rabies alert for the area surrounding East Bank Drive in the northeast Tampa area after a cat tested positive for rabies Monday [7 Mar 2022].\r\n\r\nThe cat was a black domestic short-haired stray cat. One person was confirmed to have been exposed and has begun rabies post-exposure vaccinations.\r\n \r\nThis rabies alert is for 60 days and includes the area bounded by Puritan Road on the north, 56th Street to the east, East Sligh Avenue to the south and the Hillsborough River to the west.\r\n\r\nThis is the 2nd rabies alert the health department issued in Hillsborough County Tuesday [8 Mar 2022].\r\n\r\nThe county also issued an alert for Glen Harwell Road in Plant City after a white and gray stray cat tested positive for rabies. Two people were confirmed exposed and have begun post-rabies vaccinations.\r\n\r\nThis alert is for 60 days as well and includes the area bordered by Interstate 4 to the north, Branch Forbes Road to the east, U.S. 92 to the south and Bethlehem Road to the west.\r\n \r\nAnyone who has been bitten, scratched or exposed to the saliva of these cats is asked to report the exposure to DOH-Hillsborough at 813-307-8059.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Health (DOH) is reminding residents to stay away from wild animals and make sure all their pets are vaccinated and do not roam free.\r\n \r\nRabies is a disease of the nervous system and is fatal to warm-blooded animals and humans. The only treatment for human exposure to rabies is rabies-specific immune globulin and rabies immunizations [Post Exposure Prophylaxis or PEP].\r\n\r\nPeople who have been bitten or scratched by wild or domestic animals should seek medical attention right away.\r\n\r\n[Byline: D'Ann Lawrence]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[In the 1st article from Brazil, the bat in question is most likely what is commonly known as the vampire bat. It is known for feeding on cattle and a host of other animals. There are 3 species of hematophagous bats in the Neotropical region, one of which -- _Desmodus rotundus_ -- is a well-known reservoir of rabies. This species feeds on a wide range of hosts, including humans, although it will preferentially feed on large livestock such as cattle and horses. For a picture of _D. rotundus_ go to <https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/41168-Desmodus-rotundus/browse_photos>.\r\n\r\nRabies is a viral disease affecting the central nervous system of its victim, regardless of whether it is a human victim or an animal victim. This virus has no mercy and without treatment, its victim will die. \r\n\r\nWhile we recognize rabies prevention in the form of rabies vaccination for our animals, and for some high risk human beings, such as veterinarians and persons involved in animal control, it is not a wide spread practice to vaccinate human beings against rabies. Therefore, when an individual is exposed to this lethal virus, post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) must be administered. This is a series of human immunoglobulin and PEP to prevent rabies in human beings but it must be started very soon after the exposure. In the case of bats in a room where an individual was sleeping, PEP is recommended as bats can bite a sleeping individual and not awaken them.\r\n\r\nIf you have pets, including horses and other farm animals, it is the wise, prudent move to vaccinate them against rabies. It protects your pets and yourself. Even if you do not know if there has been exposure to your animal, you are more likely to be protected. - Mod.TG\n\nProMED maps:\nBrazil: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701944,6>\nCalifornia, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701944,204>\nPolk County, Florida, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701944,9743>\nHillsborough County, Florida, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701944,4562>]\n\n[See Also:\nRabies (07): Americas (Canada, USA) fox, dog, bat, cat, human exp 20220223.8701603\r\nRabies (05): Americas (Brazil,USA) bat, fox, pets, horse, human exp 20220211.8701394\r\nRabies (04): Americas (Canada) ex Iran, dog, human exp, OIE 20220209.8701369\r\nRabies (03): Americas (USA, Canada) animals, human exp 20220205.8701273\r\nRabies (02): Americas (USA) human deaths, 2021 20220108.8700733\r\nRabies (01): Americas (Brazil, Canada, USA) animal, human exp 20220101.8700617\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nRabies (43): Americas (Canada, USA) animals, human exp 20211225.8700467\r\nRabies (42): Americas (Brazil, Canada, USA) human death, animal exp 20211127.8699909\r\nRabies (41): Americas (USA) imported dogs, rule change 20211126.8699900\r\nRabies (39): Americas (USA, Canada) animal, human 20211106.8699482\r\nRabies (36): Americas (USA) animal, human 20210930.8698792\r\nRabies (34): Americas (USA) various animals, human exp 20210912.8663860\r\nRabies (30): Americas (USA) raccoon, cat, dog, fox, human exp 20210814.8595520\r\nRabies (20): Americas (USA) imported dog 20210630.8487313\r\nRabies (11): Americas (USA) bat, human exp 20210519.8370609\r\nRabies (09): Americas (Canada, USA) wild and domestic animals, exposure 20210504.8342817\r\nRabies (03): Americas (USA) raccoon, dog, bobcat, fox, human exp 20210123.8128938\r\nRabies (02): Americas (USA, Canada) otter, fox, human exp 20210103.8066208\r\nRabies (01): Americas (USA) raccoon, dog, cat, human exp 20210102.8064117\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nRabies (33): Americas (USA) cow, skunk, cat, raccoon, human exp 20201205.7996307\r\nRabies (30): Americas (USA) coyote, bat, imported dog ex Egypt, human exp 20201108.7925072\r\nRabies (29): Americas (USA) animal, human exposure 20201101.7908381\r\nRabies (28): Americas (USA) animal, human exp 20201018.7871698\r\nRabies (27): Americas (USA) animal, human exp 20201003.7829604\r\nRabies (26): Americas (USA) bat, human exp 20200928.7818946\r\nRabies (25): Americas (USA) animal, human exp 20200904.7745166\r\nRabies (23): Americas (USA) bat 20200731.7632899\r\nRabies (10): Americas (USA) raccoon, dog, bull, human exp 20200412.7213951\r\nRabies (08): Americas (USA, Canada) cat, dog, fox, skunk, human exp 20200321.7122312\r\nRabies (06): Americas (USA) cat, fox, cow, human exp 20200302.7041402\r\nRabies (03): Americas (USA) cat, fox, otter, coyote, human exposure 20200214.6987679\r\nRabies (02): Americas (USA) raccoon, cat, human, dog exp 20200201.6943518\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nRabies (57): Americas (USA) raccoon, cat, human exp 20191226.6858881\r\nRabies (53): Americas (USA) fox, human exp 20191125.6797040\r\nRabies (50): Americas (USA) cat, dog, human exposure 20191110.6771632\r\nRabies (40): Americas (USA) bat, human exp 20190730.6595948\r\nRabies (30): Americas, USA (FL, NC) cat, fox, dog, human exposure 20190526.6488419\r\nRabies (28): Americas, USA, cattle, imported dogs, corr. 20190512.6466342]\n.................................................sb/tg/may/jh"

A similar strain has been circulating in Jordan (starting early November 2021). Their similarity has been demonstrated by their identical sequencing results which have become available on the Jordan report section in the website of the world reference laboratory for FMD, Pirbright, at <https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLMEG-2021-00020-PAT-GTR-O-O_001.pdf>.\r\n\r\nThe genotyping results of (one) sample from the West Bank are available in a separate P.A.T. report, at <https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLMEG-2021-00022-JOR-GTR-O-O_001.pdf>.\r\n\r\nThe said report includes also the genotyping results of a sample collected in a separate district of the P.A., namely the Gaza strip. The event there was reported to the OIE by the P.A. on 24 Dec 2021 (Archive number 20211224.8700454). Its details, as presented on the WRLFMD are: \r\nVirus sample name: 437694-0257/PAT/2021; \r\nSender reference: Gaza_437694-0257; \r\nLocation of origin: Northern part of the Gaza Strip;\r\nDate of collection: 12/2021; \r\nHost species: cattle. \r\nGenotyping results: FMDV O, topotype EA-3. This strain was found closely related to Egyptian strains (see the table titled \"Most Closely Related Sequences\" and the dendogram). Notably, the same topotype was reported from Gaza in February 2019 (Archive number 20190216.6320472).\r\n\r\nFMD has been reported from neighboring Israel since early February 2022. So far, 3 villages have been reportedly affected. The infected animals include dairy cattle, fattening calves and sheep. Their vaccination status is yet to be clarified. The virus was sequenced and genotyped by the Kimron Veterinary Institute as FMDV-O, PanAsia 2, ANT-10. \r\n\r\nIn summary, currently FMDV-O PanAsia-2 ANT-10 is circulating in Jordan, the West Bank (P.A.) and Israel while FMD-O EA-3 (an East African strain) has been circulating in the Gaza strip (P.A.).

She developed symptoms on 17 Nov 2021 and was admitted for treatment on 20 Nov 2021.

He developed symptoms on 18 Nov 2021 and was admitted for treatment on 22 Nov 2021. He passed away on 3 Dec 2021.\r\n\r\nFrom 2014 to date [8 Mar 2022], 73 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities. \"All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong,\" a spokesman for the CHP said.\r\n\r\nTravellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.\r\n\r\nTravellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nWhile local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments. The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:\r\n\r\n- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;\r\n- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;\r\n- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;\r\n- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and\r\n- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page and the YouTube Channel [see source URL above for these web links].\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for sharing this update on human cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 in China.\r\n\r\nThe above report mentions 2 new cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 in mainland China, both fatal, increasing the total cases in 2022 to 11 (although these 2 cases can technically be included in the 2021 tally). Accordingly, from 2014 to date, 73 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities.\r\n\r\nAvian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry such as chickens or ducks. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infections.\r\n\r\nWhenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases appears to be increasing. - Mod.UBA\n\nProMED map:\nChina: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701894,155>]\n\n[See Also:\nAvian influenza, human (09): Asia (China) H9N2 20220306.8701796\r\nAvian influenza, human (08): Asia (China) H5N6 20220302.8701722\r\nAvian influenza, human (07): Asia (China) H5N6 20220217.8701493\r\nAvian influenza, human (06): Asia (China) H9N2, H5N6 20220131.8701114\r\nAvian influenza, human (05): Asia (China) H9N2 20220123.8700993\r\nAvian influenza, human (04): Asia (China) H5N6 20220117.8700903\r\nAvian influenza, human (03): China (GD) H5N6 20220109.8700750\r\nAvian influenza, human (02): Asia (China) H9N2 20220109.8700749\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza, human (26): China (Hong Kong) H5N6 20211219.8700294\r\nAvian influenza, human (25): China (SC, GD) H5N6 20211211.8700163\r\nAvian influenza, human (24): China (GZ) H9N2 20211124.8699804\r\nAvian influenza, human (23): China (HN) H5N6 20211028.8699277\r\nAvian influenza, human (22): China (GX) H5N6 20211003.8698793\r\nAvian influenza, human (21): China (GD) H5N6 20210927.8698701\r\nAvian influenza, human (19): China (HN), H5N6 20210919.8685382\r\nAvian influenza, human (18): China (GX) H5N6 20210911.8657500\r\nAvian influenza, human (17): China (HN) H9N2 20210906.8647141\r\nAvian influenza, human (16): China (GD) H5N6 20210825.8611614\r\nAvian influenza, human (14): China (SC) H5N6 20210724.8542205\r\nAvian influenza, human (12): China (SC) H5N6 20210716.8519755\r\nAvian influenza, human (11): China (SC) H5N6 20210612.8437106\r\nAvian influenza, human (08): China (GD) H9N2 20210508.8345139\r\nAvian influenza, human (07): China (FJ, HU) H9N2 20210425.8327505\r\nAvian influenza, human (06): Laos, H5N6, 1st case 20210412.8301144\r\nAvian influenza, human (05): Nigeria, A/H5 20210407.8294492\r\nAvian influenza, human (04): China (GX) H5N6, fatal 20210325.8265645\r\nAvian influenza, human (03): Russia, H5N8, update 20210228.8217634\r\nAvian influenza, human (02): Russia, H5N8, 1st case 20210221.8204014\r\nAvian influenza, human (01): China (GD) H9N2, alert 20210120.8111218\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza, human (05): China (GD) H9N2, new case 20201004.7835005\r\nAvian influenza, human (04): China (FJ, SD) H9N2, new cases 20200530.7392699\r\nAvian influenza, human (03): China (GD) H9N2, WHO 20200407.7195272\r\nAvian influenza, human (02): Senegal, India, H9N2, WHO, RFI 20200309.7059887\r\nAvian influenza, human: China (Hong Kong) H9N2 20200208.6967624\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza, human (11): China (FJ, AH) H9N2 20191211.6834041\r\nAvian influenza, human (08): Oman (BS) H9N2, RFI 20190508.6460574\r\nAvian influenza, human (03): China (HN) H9N2, 2018 20190205.6295949\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza, human (24): China (GD, GX) H9N2 20181226.6223398\r\nAvian influenza, human (13): China (GD) H9N2 20180801.5940642\r\nAvian influenza (118): India (BR) backyard, HPAI H5N1, OIE 20181228.6226636\r\nAvian influenza (77): Nepal (TH) poultry, HPAI H5N1, OIE 20180530.5828169\r\nAvian influenza (75): Nepal (Narayani) poultry, HPAI H5N1, OIE 20180519.5805891\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza, human (65): China (GD) H9N2, human-animal interface, WHO 20170812.5242688\r\n2016\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza, human (60): China (JX) H9N2 20160912.4481431\r\nAvian influenza, human (59): China (YN) H9N2 20160901.4451359\r\nAvian influenza, human (51): China (GD) H9N2 20160621.4299567\r\nAvian influenza, human (31): China H7N9, avian flu update, China (FJ) H7N9, China (SC) H9N2 20160318.4101269\r\nAvian influenza, human (14): Egypt A(H5N1,H9N2) CDC/EID 20160122.3956280\r\n2015\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza, human (130): China (AH, HN) H9N2 20151217.3867941\r\nAvian influenza, human (120): Bangladesh, H9N2 20150923.3666519\r\nAvian influenza, human (108): Egypt, H9N2, influenza B 20150522.3378923\r\nAvian influenza, human (44): Egypt (AS) H9N2, 1st case 20150215.3168314\r\n2014\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza, human (78): China, H7N9, new cases, H9N2 control 20140227.2304226\r\nAvian influenza, human (02): China (HK) H9N2 ex (HN) 20140102.2148327]\n.................................................uba/rd/jh"

Meningococcal infections have been reported among young children in the country recently, the ministry said on Thursday [10 Mar 2022], urging parents and guardians to take precautions to protect their children from the disease.\r\n\r\nThe disease is caused by bacteria named _Neisseria meningitidis_ and can cause infections in the linings of the brain or the blood, or both. It has a high mortality rate if untreated, but is vaccine-preventable. The common symptoms of the disease include sudden fever, vomiting, nausea, headache, a stiff neck, backache and increased sensitivity to light.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n\n[_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), infects only humans; there is no animal reservoir, and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_, which colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat, is spread person to person by sharing respiratory and throat secretions (e.g., coughing or kissing). Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days.\r\n\r\nPeople at increased risk of IMD include household members and roommates of a patient with IMD, and anyone with direct contact with the patient's oral secretions, such as a boyfriend or girlfriend. These close contacts should receive antibiotics to help prevent them from getting the disease.\r\n\r\nMeningococcal meningitis occurs most frequently in the elderly, infants, and teenagers and young adults, especially if living in group settings, such as dormitories, boarding schools and military bases. Certain rare medical conditions and medications increase the risk for IMD, including complement component deficiencies, functional or anatomic asplenia, HIV/AIDS, and complement inhibitor medications, e.g., eculizumab (Soliris) and ravulizumab (Ultomiris).\r\n\r\nWe are not told in the news report above the demographic characteristics or underlying medical conditions of the patients in the outbreak of IMD in Mongolia, other than they were young children. Nor are we told the number of cases, the timeline over which the cases occurred, or the geographic distribution of the cases.\r\n\r\nMeningococci are classified into serogroups based on the antigenic specificity of their polysaccharide capsule. Although there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, 6 serogroups (A, B, C, X, W, and Y) cause almost all IMD globally. Immunity following the use of a meningococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. Some vaccines contain capsular polysaccharides (A, C, Y, W), conjugated to a protein, e.g., the MenC and the quadrivalent MenACWY vaccines. Conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than vaccines that contain polysaccharide alone. Serogroup B (MenB) vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens because group B capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and may stimulate autoantibodies.\r\n\r\nSome countries, such as in the UK, include meningococcal vaccines in their routine childhood vaccine schedule (<https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/uk-schedule>). We are not told in the news report above if Mongolia's routine childhood vaccine schedule includes a meningococcal vaccine, the vaccine status of the infected children, or the meningococcal serogroup(s) of the outbreak strain(s).\r\n\r\nMore information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML\n\nProMED map:\nMongolia: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701950,1>]\n\n[See Also:\nMeningococcal meningitis - Europe: (Belgium) prolonged outbreak, preschool, sg B 20220304.8701800\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA: (MI) college student, frat party 20220129.8701149\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - UK: (England) students, sg B 20220121.8701008\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - UK (02): (England) college students, RFI 20211111.8699590\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Congo DR (03): (TO) fatal, sg W, mass vaccine 20211028.8699317\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Congo DR (02): (TO) fatal, sg W, mass vaccine, WHO 20210921.8691501\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Congo DR: (TO) fatal, WHO, RFI 20210909.8656884\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - New Zealand: (CA) fatal, college student 20210828.8628864\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - UK: (England) decreased incid., 1st 3m, 2021 vs 2020 20210715.8521356\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Australia (02): (NS) sg B 20210528.8388941\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria: (SO) susp, fatal, schoolchildren, RFI 20210326.8271578\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Australia: (WA) RFI 20210122.8125564\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Australia (02): (SA) fatal, infant 20201109.7928745\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Australia: (WA) sg W, Y, B 20200516.7342101\r\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Costa Rica: 3rd-gen. cephalosporin resistance, RFI 20200226.7028303]\n.................................................sb/ml/rd/jh"

Its host reservoir, the marsh rice rat (_Oryzomys palustris_), inhabits coastal saltmarshes of Louisiana, a region extensively impacted by anthropogenic disturbances, such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill. The oil spill presents an opportunity to investigate how a large-scale ecological disturbance can influence the hantavirus host-pathogen dynamic by examining BAYV presence in its reservoir host species in areas with different oiling histories. Here, we: (1) quantify BAYV prevalence in the rice rat in coastal saltmarshes of Louisiana; (2) assess whether prevalence is driven by rice rat demographics, seasonality, or association with habitat characteristics; and (3) determine whether these factors differ by marsh oiling history. We collected mark-recapture data and blood and tissue samples over 5 years (2013-2017) at oiled, unoiled, and reference sites. Testing of the samples for BAYV revealed an antibody and RNA prevalence of 13.7%. Logistic regression analysis found that prevalence varied seasonally and interannually, and in July 2016 reached 30.8%. Sex (male) and increasing cover of _Sporobolus alterniflorus_ and open water compared to _Juncus roemerianus_ and bare ground were the strongest predictors of hantavirus prevalence. Abundance estimates derived from Huggins closed-capture models were greatest at oiled sites, but oiling treatment had no residual influence on BAYV prevalence, and abundance and prevalence were not correlated. This study supports the hypothesis that habitat is a main driver of hantavirus prevalence in the host and implies that continued and future disturbances in the region will likely impact the rice rat-BAYV dynamic by altering plant communities and landscape structure.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this report.\r\n\r\nAlthough cases of Bayou hantavirus causing human hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS) have occurred infrequently, they have been diagnosed in eastern Texas and Louisiana. The above report underscores the importance of the relationship of habitat of the rodent reservoir host, the marsh rice rat (_Oryzomys palustris_), and prevalence of Bayou hantavirus. Human or naturally caused habitat changes can, in turn, affect BAY virus prevalence.

Officials said the infected patients were residents of Palm Desert, Palm Springs and neighboring communities. None of the parties were identified. The California Department of Public Health is collaborating with the county in seeking to identify potential sources.\r\n\r\nPrior to the recent instances, there were no diagnosed cases of Legionnaires' disease within the county over the last few years, according to the Department of Public Health website. The _Legionella_ bacterium is commonly spread through aerosolized water droplets or mists, including via showers, hot tubs and air-conditioning units. It's not known to be transmitted person to person.\r\n\r\nThose most susceptible to suffering life-threatening impacts are smokers, seniors and anyone who is immunodepressed, according to officials. The respiratory disease, and its milder variant Pontiac fever, typically develops over a 2-day to 10-day period and initially begins with headaches, muscle aches and fever of 104 degrees F [40 deg C] or higher. Additional symptoms that surface can include shortness of breath, coughing with mucus production, chest pain, gastrointestinal dysfunction, including nausea and diarrhea, and even inability to think clearly, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mayo Clinic and other sources.\r\n\r\nAntibiotics are usually prescribed for those suffering complications. The disease was first identified in 1976, following an outbreak among attendees of an American Legion convention in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n\n[The news article above reports that a cluster of 20 cases of Legionnaires' disease has occurred over the past 6 months in the nearby towns of Palm Desert, Palm Springs, and neighboring communities in Coachella Valley in southern California, USA. A map of this area can be found at <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Coachella+Valley>.\r\n\r\nWe are not told if genotyping has been done on _Legionella_ isolated from the patients. Genotyping the clinical isolates will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.\r\n\r\n_Legionella_ are gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, like lakes and streams, and in plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, and hot water tanks and heaters. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C [77-104 deg F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.\r\n\r\nEradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/>).\r\n\r\n_Legionella pneumophila_, the usual _Legionella_ species causing legionellosis in the USA, has been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/>). Monitoring of _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249>).\r\n\r\nLegionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of the disease. Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis with fever, malaise, and muscle aches that are less severe than Legionnaires' disease; symptoms of Pontiac fever resolve in 2 to 5 days without antibiotic treatment (<https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/clinical-features.html>). Risk factors for Legionnaires' disease include age 50 years or older; smoking (current or historical); chronic lung disease (such as emphysema or COPD); immune system disorders due to disease or medication; systemic malignancy; and underlying illness such as diabetes, renal failure, or hepatic failure (<https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/disease-specifics.html>). Legionnaires' disease takes its name from an outbreak among people attending an American Legion convention at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia in 1976.\r\n\r\nHumans acquire Legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease has also been described (Correia AM, Ferreira JS, Borges V, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 497-8; <http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356>). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.\r\n\r\nMore information on this cluster of Legionnaires' disease cases in southern California would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML\n\nProMED map:\nCalifornia, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701956,204>]\n\n[See Also:\nLegionellosis - USA: (MO) nosocomial, RFI 20220127.8701094\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nLegionellosis - USA (16): (IN) prison, fatal, RFI 20211206.8700082\r\nLegionellosis - USA (15): (IN) prison, RFI 20211203.8700037\r\nLegionellosis - USA (14): (OR) 20211029.8699339\r\nLegionellosis - USA (13): (CT) prison 20211021.8699173\r\nLegionellosis - USA (12): (OR) fatal, apt. complex, cases after remediation, RFI 20211019.8699152\r\nLegionellosis - USA (11): (NY) 20211015.8699070\r\nLegionellosis - USA (10): (OR) fatal, apartment complex, cases after remediation 20211015.8699064\r\nLegionellosis - USA (09): (NYC) northern Manhattan, hospital cooling tower, RFI 20210925.8698707\r\nLegionellosis - USA (08): (NJ) fatal, RFI 20210925.8698688\r\nLegionellosis - USA (07): (ME) 20210830.8633233\r\nLegionellosis - USA (06): (NYC) northern Manhattan 20210820.8608820\r\nLegionellosis - USA (05): (MN) hotel, hot tub/pool susp 20210710.8508983\r\nLegionellosis - USA (04): (OR) fatal, apt. complex, more cases after remediation 20210625.8475267\r\nLegionellosis - USA (03): (NJ) fatal 20210316.8251354\r\nLegionellosis - USA (02): (OR) fatal, apartment complex 20210108.8084536\r\nLegionellosis - USA: (OR) fatal, apartment complex 20210106.8078118]\n.................................................sb/ml/rd/may/jh"

He was treated in hospital before being discharged and is continuing to recover in a rehabilitation facility.\r\n\r\nThis is the 1st confirmed case from the Goulburn area. Urgent investigations into the location of his exposure are underway.\r\n\r\nSeveral more people in NSW are currently undergoing further testing for JE and more cases are expected to be confirmed over the coming days and weeks.\r\n\r\nLocally acquired cases of JE have never previously been identified in NSW in animals or humans. Since late February 2022, the JE virus has been confirmed in samples from pig farms in NSW, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia.\r\n\r\nThe JE virus is spread by mosquitoes and can infect animals and humans. The virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and it cannot be caught by eating pork or other pig products.\r\n\r\nThere is no specific treatment for JE, which can cause severe neurological illness with headache, convulsions and reduced consciousness in some cases.\r\n\r\nThe best thing people throughout the state can do to protect themselves and their families against JE is to take steps to avoid mosquito bites.\r\n\r\nSimple actions you can take include:\r\n- Avoid going outdoors during peak mosquito times, especially at dawn and dusk, and close to wetland and bushland areas.\r\n- Wear long sleeves and pants outdoors (reduce skin exposure). Also wear shoes and socks where possible. There are insecticides (e.g. permethrin) available for treating clothing for those spending extended periods outdoors.\r\n- Apply repellent to all areas of exposed skin, especially those that contain DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus which are the most effective against mosquitoes. The strength of a repellent determines the duration of protection with the higher concentrations providing longer periods of protection. Always check the label for reapplication times.\r\n- Reapply repellent after swimming. The duration of protection from repellent is also reduced with perspiration, such as during strenuous activity or hot weather so it may need to be reapplied more frequently.\r\n- Apply the sunscreen 1st and then apply the repellent. Be aware that DEET-containing repellents may decrease the sun protection factor (SPF) of sunscreens so you may need to re-apply the sunscreen more frequently.\r\n- For children in particular -- most skin repellents are safe for use on children aged 3 months and older when used according to directions, although some formulations are only recommended for children aged 12 months and older -- always check the product. Infants aged younger than 3 months can be protected from mosquitoes by using an infant carrier draped with mosquito netting that is secured along the edges.\r\n- If camping, ensure the tent has fly screens to prevent mosquitoes entering.\r\n- Mosquito coils and other devices that release insecticides can assist in reducing mosquito bites but should be used in combination with topical insect repellents.\r\n- Reduce all water holding containers around the home where mosquitoes could breed. Mosquitoes only need a small amount of liquid to breed.\r\n\r\nFor further information on mosquito-borne disease and ways to protect yourself go to our website [<https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/environment/pests/vector/Pages/resources.aspx>].\r\n\r\nFact sheets on specific mosquito-borne diseases, including Japanese encephalitis Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus, are available on our website [<https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/environment/pests/vector/Pages/factsheets.aspx>].\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n\n[Transmission of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus remains active in New South Wales. The number of reported human JE cases in the state has increased from 2 on 7 Mar 2022 to 5 today (11 Mar 2022). No reports have been issued yet of the frequency and locations where JE virus has been found in vector mosquitoes, although vector surveillance is doubtless going on. Given the reports of flooding and rains in eastern Australia, mosquito populations are likely to remain abundant with ongoing JE virus transmission to people and pigs. Avoidance of mosquito bites as recommended above is the only preventive measure, other than vaccination, for people to avoid JE virus infections. - Mod.TY]\n\n[See Also:\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (06): (QL, SA) pig 20220311.8701896\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (05): (NS) 20220308.8701869\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (04) 20220305.8701811\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (03): (VI, QL) spread 20220305.8701785\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia (02): (QL, NS, VI) pig, OIE 20220304.8701778\r\nJapanese encephalitis - Australia: alert 20220228.8701705]\n.................................................sb/jh/may/jh"

While official counts from countries vary, an estimated 5.9 million COVID-19 deaths were recorded globally in 2020 and 2021. The Lancet study compared that number to weekly or monthly data on deaths from all causes in those 2 years and up to 11 years prior from 74 countries and 266 states and provinces, using government websites, the World Mortality Database, Human Mortality Database, and European Statistical Office.\r\n\r\nExcess mortality was calculated as observed mortality minus expected mortality. The authors also excluded weekly death tolls during times of anomalies, such as heat waves, from their calculations.\r\n\r\nThey estimate that the global COVID-19 death toll is closer to 18.2 million, and the excess death rate caused by the virus is 120 per 100 000 population globally. Some countries may have more than 300 excess deaths per 100 000 population.\r\n\r\nThe study showed stark regional differences in excess deaths, with the highest rates seen in Andean Latin America (512 deaths per 100 000 population), eastern Europe (345 deaths per 100 000), central Europe (316 deaths per 100 000), southern Africa (309 deaths per 100 000), and Central America (274 deaths per 100 000). But several territories outside these regions, including parts of Asia and several southern US states, also had high rates.\r\n\r\nThe authors said the highest estimated excess deaths at a country level occurred in India (4.1 million), the United States (1.1 million), Russia (1.1 million), Mexico (798 000), Brazil (792 000), Indonesia (736 000), and Pakistan (664 000). Together these countries accounted for almost half of the COVID-19 deaths seen in the past 2 years.\r\n\r\n\"Our findings indicate that the full impact of the pandemic has been much greater than what is suggested by official statistics,\" the authors said.\r\n\r\nThe countries with the fewest excess deaths were Iceland (48 fewer deaths per 100 000), Australia (38 fewer deaths per 100 000), and Singapore (16 fewer deaths per 100 000).\r\n\r\n\"Understanding the true death toll from the pandemic is vital for effective public health decision-making. Studies from several countries, including Sweden and the Netherlands, suggest COVID-19 was the direct cause of most excess deaths, but we currently don't have enough evidence for most locations,\" said lead study author Haidong Wang, PhD, of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, in a Lancet press release (<https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/945949>).\r\n\r\n\"Further research will help to reveal how many deaths were caused directly by COVID-19, and how many occurred as an indirect result of the pandemic.\" The authors of the study also suggest that the huge gap between official death counts and the estimate provided from excess mortality counts points to a need to strengthen death registration systems around the world.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] CIDRAP News\r\n[A] China\r\nDate: Fri 11 Mar 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/chinese-provincial-capital-locks-down-countrys-covid-cases-rise>\r\n\r\n\r\nChina's COVID-19 cases today [11 Mar 2022] continue to rise to their highest levels since February 2020, with the capital of Jilin province, Changchun, now on lockdown to curb the spread of the virus. China today [11 Mar 2022] reported 1100 new cases, 703 of them listed as asymptomatic, according to the National Health Commission (NHC). The country is among the few with a \"zero COVID\" policy but is struggling with the much more transmissible omicron variant.\r\n\r\nThe city of Changchun, with a population of 9 million, is under lockdown as mass testing of all citizens begins, according to Kyodo News, a news service based in Japan. About 70 cases in the city have been confirmed this month [March 2022] (<https://bit.ly/3t7TlsA>).\r\n\r\nOf today's [11 Mar 2022] new cases, 246 were in Jilin province, including 23 in Changchun. All but 2 infections from the city today [11 Mar 2022] were asymptomatic, according to the NHC. Elsewhere in China, the Shandong province city of Yucheng, home to 500 000 people, is also on lockdown, according to NPR [National Public Radio] (<https://n.pr/3Ja24jd>).\r\n\r\nHong Kong's surge continues, with 31 402 new cases today [11 Mar 2022], according to the Centre for Health Protection. The area's outbreak has come with a spike in deaths, especially in older people, that is overwhelming local mortuary services (<https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202203/10/P2022031000650.htm>).\r\n\r\nLeaders today [11 Mar 2022] announced that vaccination efforts will focus on older people and children, according to Reuters. Seniors in Hong Kong have had low vaccination uptake. Officials have also said they will focus resources on older people (<https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN2L80DN>).\r\n\r\nIn other global developments:\r\n- The latest COVID infection survey from the UK Office for National Statistics said the number of people testing positive for the virus increased last week across all of UK nations. The rise reflects an increase in those ages 25 and older, with levels declining in children. The small overall rise in the countries also came with a rise in omicron BA.2 subvariant infections. Hospitalizations were up across all age-groups (<https://bit.ly/3vZMH9k>).\r\n- The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has added a delta-omicron recombinant, which has a delta backbone and a mostly omicron BA.1 spike, to its variants under monitoring. It said a few cases have been detected in Denmark, France, and the Netherlands (<https://bit.ly/3KEWiqa>).\r\n- Japan-based Fujifilm today [11 Mar 2022] announced that it has halted enrollment in the phase 3 trial of favipiravir as a treatment for COVID-19 because with milder illnesses from omicron, it would be difficult to assess the drug's impact on severe disease (<https://www.fujifilm.com/jp/en/news/hq/7721>).\r\n\r\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n----\r\n[B] Pfizer vaccine\r\nDate: Fri 11 Mar 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/chinese-provincial-capital-locks-down-countrys-covid-cases-rise>\r\n\r\n\r\nReceiving 2 doses of Pfizer vaccine showed moderate to good protection in 2 age-groups of children, researchers reported today [11 Mar 2022] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). They based their findings on an ongoing cohort survey that tracks infections in children ages 6 months to 17 years in 4 states (<http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7111e1>).\r\n\r\nFor children ages 5-11, vaccine effectiveness was moderate, at 31% for prevention of symptomatic and asymptomatic disease. For kids ages 12-15, the vaccine doses were 59% effective.\r\n\r\nResearchers said wide and overlapping confidence intervals suggest the estimates might not be significantly different and are similar to a recent vaccine effectiveness report of 45%-51% against emergency department and urgent care visits for omicron infections across the 2 age-groups.\r\n\r\nThe authors said kids infected with omicron despite having received 2 vaccine doses spent an average of one-half day less in bed than unvaccinated study participants. \"All eligible children and adolescents should remain up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations,\" they wrote.\r\n\r\nIn other US developments:\r\n- White House officials yesterday [10 Mar 2022] warned that key pandemic programs could run out of funds if Congress doesn't quickly authorize USD 15.6 billion in new funding for the efforts, according to Politico (<https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/10/more-covid-aid-uncertain-00016212>).\r\n- The Transportation Security Agency yesterday [10 Mar 2022] announced that the mask requirement for planes and public transportation will be extended through 18 Apr 2022, according to the Associated Press. The rule was originally set to end next week, on 18 Mar 2022 (<https://bit.ly/3pYW4CD>).\r\n- Nursing home resident COVID-19 booster rates in about one-third of US states lag the national average, with 3 states -- Florida, Arizona, and Nevada -- yet to reach an average of 60% boosted in each facility, according to ABC News (<https://abcn.ws/3w1ActW>).\r\n\r\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 11 Mar 2022)\r\nDate: Fri 11 Mar 2022\r\nSource: WHO [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://covid19.who.int/table>\r\n\r\n\r\n*Daily case reports as of 11 Mar 2022 16:48 CET\r\n\r\nSurveillance\r\n------------\r\nWHO region (no. countries/territories):\r\nTotal confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWestern Pacific Region (19): 30 746 422 (700 487) / 191 788 (1025)\r\nEuropean Region (61): 186 421 626 (788 125) / 1 900 260 (2183)\r\nSouth-East Asia Region (10): 56 384 866 (47 227) / 768 264 (623)\r\nEastern Mediterranean Region (22): 21 384 916 (9356) / 337 780 (168)\r\nRegion of the Americas (54): 148 631 929 (156 303) / 2 658 411 (3502)\r\nAfrican Region (49): 8 481 781 (3022) / 170 543 (36)\r\nCases on an international conveyance: 764 (0) / 13 (0)\r\n\r\nConfirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\r\nGrand total: 452 052 304 (1 704 520) / 6 027 059 (7537)\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[Data by country, area, or territory for 10 Mar 2022 can be accessed at <https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WHO%20Data%20Tables%20MAR11_1647109366.pdf>.\r\n\r\n- The Americas region reported 9.1% of cases and 46.4% of deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported more than 148.63 million cases, 2nd to the European region as the most severely affected region.

Ltd. product was sold in the Crystal Mall, Unit 1162-4500 Kingsway, Burnaby, B.C.\r\n\r\nAccording to the health alert, monkshood is the common name for a plant called _Aconitum_. Roots of the plant, which look very similar to ginger root, contain the toxin aconitine which can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, weakness, irregular ventricular contractions, and in severe cases, death.\r\n\r\nWing Hing brand sand ginger powder was sold in 70 gram [2.5 oz] packages. There is no identifying lot information on the packaging. \r\n\r\nFraser Health Public Health advises people who have this sand ginger powder to not consume it and discard it immediately.\r\n\r\nFraser Health has seized the remaining product from the store and continues to work with other agencies to ensure it is further removed from the marketplace.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Sand ginger, a part of the galangal family has a very different taste than does the common Chinese ginger.\r\n\r\nSand ginger has been used to treat some bacterial issues such as Staph infections and reportedly, some cancers.\r\n\r\nIts taste is reported to be a sharp peppery taste when used fresh. As a dried product, it is said to have a slight cinnamon flavor but a still sharp peppery taste.\r\n\r\nAccording to the article, this is a dried product, not fresh. It is not clear if the _Aconitum_ was growing in the field and some of the roots were mistakenly harvested or if someone did not know the differences in the plants. \r\n\r\nThe _Aconitum_ family is a very large group (over 250 species) of flowering plants with a large number of different common names, leaf shapes and flower colors. Among the common names are monkshood (please see the photos) mousebane, wolf's-bane, leopard's bane, women's bane, devil's helment, blue rocked, queen of poisons. This is a very toxic group of plants.\r\n\r\nThe genus Aconitium contains the toxic agent aconitine and other related alkaloids, especially in the roots and tubers. The toxic agent Aconitine is a very potent neurotoxin and cardiotoxin. It causes a persistent depolarization of neuronal sodium channels in tetrodotoxin-sensitive tissues. The sodium influx in these channels delays the repolarization causing excitability and potentially leading to diarrhea, convulsions, ventricular arrhytmia and death. These conditions require immediate treatment.\r\n\r\nSkin contact with the plant generally does not result in clinical signs, but on occasion paraesthesia, including tingling and feelings of coldness in the extremities, has been reported, as has mild toxicity (headache, nausea and palpitations).\r\n\r\nClinical signs start as quickly as immediately but generally within one hour. Without rapid treatment death usually follows in 4-6 hours.\r\n\r\nTreatment is primarily supportive for the blood pressure and cardiac rhythm (it could vary from tachycardia to bradycardia, but more frequently seems to be bradycardia). Evacuation of the gastrointestinal tract may be beneficial in reducing toxin absorption. In some patients, the use of activated charcoal has been helpful.\r\n\r\n_Aconitum_ sp. (also known as Monk's hood, please see photos below):\r\n\"This is a genus of over 250 species of herbaceous perennials of which most are extremely poisonous. They are mostly found in mountainous areas of the northern hemisphere in moist but well-drained soils in forests, natural areas, moist woods and sitting along creek banks. These plants will grow better in cool summer areas.\r\n\r\n\"The plants generally have lobed to deeply lobed leaves with toothed margins and clusters of flowers with the characteristic upper hood giving it the common name of Monk's Hood and Helmet Flower. The showy flowers appear in summer and range in color from blues, purples to white. \r\n\r\n\"Plant in humus-rich moist soil that drains well. In the southern portion of its range, it will need afternoon sun. Use in groups, borders or naturalized areas. After flowering, cut the plants back to promote re-blooming.\r\n\r\n\"Although used in the landscape, Monkshood is poisonous, with a narcotic juice present in the leaves and roots. Do not plant near the vegetable garden, where its fleshy roots could be mistaken for Jerusalem artichokes. Wearing gloves is advisable when handling this plant.\"\r\n(Extracted from: <https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/aconitum/>)\r\n\r\nThere are a number of different species and colors of Monkshood. All are toxic.\r\n\r\nPhotos may be seen at:\r\n<https://bit.ly/36gx2YE>, <https://bit.ly/3MEnbwi>, and <https://bit.ly/3MNyaUr>. - Mod.TG\n\nProMED map:\nBritish Columbia Province, Canada: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701961,264>]\n\n[See Also:\nToxic tea, aconitine - USA: (CA) 20170312.4895129]\n.................................................jh/tg/may/jh"

All birds in this commercial flock will be destroyed. The confirmation came from a poultry flock in Charles Mix County in southeastern South Dakota along the Missouri River. The river is of course a major flyway for spring bird migration. South Dakota now joins Iowa, Missouri, Indiana, the Carolinas, and Maryland as states confirming HPAI infection.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's not a matter of if it comes to Minnesota -- it's when,\" so says Minnesota Board of Animal Health senior veterinarian Shauna Voss. It's only been 7 years since around 9 million birds across 110 Minnesota farms were killed by avian influenza or were euthanized to prevent the spread. The economic impact on producers was nothing short of catastrophic. Now in 2022, avian influenza has been detected in the United States. Earlier this year [2022] it was first discovered in birds in the Carolinas.\r\n\r\nThe Eurasian H5 avian influenza in hunter-harvested waterfowl was first detected by Clemson University scientists then confirmed by federal testing, and the federal Agriculture Department alerted global health officials, according to The Associated Press.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported an outbreak of a highly pathogenic bird flu strain in a turkey flock in Indiana. This instantly triggered a ban on Indiana poultry from countries like China and Taiwan. Certainly, many more trade restrictions will be put in place and unfortunately, it's also fairly certain many more cases will soon be discovered. What makes the Indiana discoveries so critical is the state's location within the Mississippi Flyway. Bird flu doesn't originate in commercial poultry flocks but is instead brought to flocks through migratory birds often through a shared water source. The risk of the pathogen to people is low but it spreads very quickly through commercial bird populations.\r\n\r\nIn 2015 North Dakota had 2 cases of avian flu affecting over 100 000 birds.\r\n\r\nThe Bismarck Tribune reports there are 9 turkey farms in North Dakota producing around a million birds annually. But all poultry producers need to be on the lookout for sick birds or a drop in egg production.\r\n\r\n\"As migration takes place this spring, we encourage producers to focus on biosecurity,\" North Dakota State Vet Dr. Ethan Andress said. \"Anyone involved with poultry production from backyard birds to a commercial operation should review and understand how the virus could spread to their birds, and prevent the exposure before it happens.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the numbers are still small, we're all well aware of how quickly a pandemic can spread. For information about biosecurity measures you can take with your birds along with updates on virus activity across the country see this site: <https://www.nd.gov/ndda/disease/avian-influenza>. [This particular site has some biosecurity tips for every bird producers. - Mod.TG]\r\n\r\n[Byline: Scott McGowan]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] Delaware (New Castle County) and Maryland (Queen Anne's County): commercial flocks\r\nDate: Wed 9 Mar 2022\r\nSource: Delaware Government [edited]\r\n<https://news.delaware.gov/2022/03/09/two-additional-cases-of-avian-influenza-confirmed-on-delaware-and-maryland-farms/>\r\n\r\n\r\nFederal laboratory testing has confirmed 2 cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) -- 1 pullet operation in New Castle County, Delaware, and 1 broiler flock in Queen Anne's County, Maryland. Following an investigation by the Delaware and Maryland Departments of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory has confirmed poultry from these farms have tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI).\r\n\r\nThese avian influenza findings follow previously announced cases on farms in New Castle County, Delaware, and Cecil County, Maryland. Following these cases, federal and state partners have greatly expanded their surveillance sampling and testing regimen to better protect the poultry industry on the Delmarva Peninsula.\r\n\r\nState officials have quarantined all affected premises, and birds on the properties are being or have been depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from affected flocks will not enter the food system.\r\n\r\nAvian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads quickly among birds through nasal and eye secretions and manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. This virus affects poultry, like chickens, ducks, and turkeys, along with some wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and raptors.\r\n\r\nConsidering these new cases and the prevalence of the virus in the wild bird population, all poultry owners need to increase their vigilance in protecting their flocks from contracting avian influenza.\r\n\r\nKey biosecurity practices:\r\n\u2022 Clean and disinfect vehicles. Don't walk through or drive trucks, tractors, or equipment in areas where waterfowl or other wildlife feces may be. If you can't avoid this, clean your shoes, vehicle, and equipment thoroughly to prevent bringing disease agents back to your flock. This is especially important when visiting with farmers or those who hunt wildfowl, such as when gathering at a local coffee shop, restaurant, or gas station.\r\n\u2022 Remove loose feed. Don't give wild birds, rodents, and insects a free lunch! Remove spilled or uneaten feed immediately and ensure feed storage units are secure and free of holes. Wild birds can carry HPAI.\r\n\u2022 Keep visitors to a minimum. Only allow those people who take care of your poultry to come in contact with your birds, including family and friends. Make sure everyone who has contact with your flock follows biosecurity principles.\r\n\u2022 Wash your hands before and after coming in contact with live poultry. Wash with soap and water (always your 1st choice). If using a hand sanitizer, remove manure, feathers, and other materials from your hands because disinfectants will not penetrate organic matter or caked-on dirt.\r\n\u2022 Provide disposable boot covers (preferred) or disinfectant footbaths for anyone having contact with your flock. If using a footbath, be sure to remove all droppings, mud, or debris from boots and shoes using a long-handled scrub brush BEFORE stepping into the disinfectant footbath, and always keep it clean.\r\n\u2022 Change clothes before entering poultry areas and before exiting the property. When handling birds, visitors should wear protective outer garments or disposable coveralls, boots, and headgear. Shower out and change clothes when leaving the facility.\r\n\u2022 Clean and disinfect tools or equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility. Before allowing vehicles, trucks, tractors, or tools and equipment (e.g., egg flats and cases) that have come in contact with birds or their droppings to exit the property, ensure they are cleaned and disinfected to prevent contaminated equipment from transporting disease. Do not move or reuse items that cannot be cleaned and disinfected, such as cardboard egg flats.\r\n\u2022 Look for signs of illness. Know the warning signs of infectious bird diseases.\r\n\r\nIf you have sick poultry or experience increased mortality in your flock:\r\n\u2022 Commercial poultry producers should follow the procedures of contacting the company they grow for when they notice signs of disease.\r\n\u2022 Backyard flock owners who notice any of the signs of HPAI in their flock should contact:\r\n - in Delaware, email the Delaware Poultry Health Hotline at <poultry.health@delaware.gov> or call 302-698-4507 and provide your contact information, size of flock, location, and concerns.\r\n - In Maryland, report any unusual or sudden increases in sick birds to the MDA Animal Health Program at 410-841-5810. Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to <MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov>.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] Delaware, Maryland, Missouri: commercial flocks\r\nDate: Thu 10 Mar 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/three-states-report-more-avian-flu-outbreaks-poultry>\r\n\r\n\r\nDelaware, Maryland, and Missouri reported more highly pathogenic avian flu outbreaks at commercial poultry farms, part of ongoing activity over the past several weeks that has led to the loss of nearly 3 million chickens and turkeys.\r\n\r\nAlso, federal officials reported 50 more highly pathogenic H5 detections from testing in wild birds, including the 1st in waterfowl in Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska.\r\n\r\nDelaware reported a 2nd outbreak in New Castle County, near Wilmington on the Delaware Bay, which was confirmed on [8 Mar 2022] and affected 265 000 pullet chickens, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS).\r\n\r\nIn neighboring Maryland, the state also reported a second outbreak, this time at a broiler flock of 150 000 birds in Queen Anne's County in the eastern half of the state, according to the USDA. A joint statement from the agriculture departments in Delaware and Maryland said the outbreaks involve H5N1. They added that state and federal officials have dramatically expanded surveillance to protect poultry in the Delmarva Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe Delmarva Peninsula poultry production area also includes Virginia's eastern shore. The Delmarva Chicken Association said about 12% of the nation's poultry supply comes from the area and that the recent outbreaks are the region's first since 2004. It noted that the 2 earlier outbreaks in Delaware and Maryland involved layer farms.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, Missouri reported 2 more outbreaks in addition to earlier detections in Bates County (backyard poultry) and Stoddard County (commercial chickens). In an update, the Missouri Department of Agriculture said the virus struck a turkey farm housing 27 000 birds in Jasper Country and a commercial poultry farm housing 37 770 in Lawrence County. Both locations are in southwestern Missouri.\r\n\r\nIn other avian flu developments, APHIS reported 50 more highly pathogenic H5 detections from wild bird sampling, including the first in waterfowl in Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska, raising the total to 357 from 20 states.\r\n\r\nIndiana's positive sample was from a wild duck harvested by a hunter in Dubois County, which had already reported outbreaks on turkey farms. Kansas has 5 detections, all involving hunter-harvested snow geese in Barton County, which is in the central part of the state.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Missouri had 22 detections, all involving hunter-harvested birds and mostly in snow geese. One was in Buchanan County in the northwest, while the others were in Chariton County, located in the north central part of the state. Nebraska's detection was in a wild goose found dead in Lancaster County, in the southeastern part of the state near Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe other detections were in states where testing had already found the virus in waterfowl or other birds: Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Most of the birds were tested after they were found dead.\r\n\r\nThe outbreaks in wild birds and poultry involve the Eurasian H5N1 strain that is circulating in a number of world regions, including Europe, where the virus has caused substantial poultry losses. The virus has also sickened one person in the United Kingdom who had close contact with poultry. The risk to humans is thought to be low, except for people who have close contact with sick birds.\r\n\r\nMonitoring is under way in the United States in people exposed to the affected flocks, and so far, no illnesses have been reported.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall \r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n******\r\n[4] Iowa (Taylor County): commercial flock\r\nDate: Fri 11 Mar 2022\r\nSource: Iowa Capital Dispatch [edited]\r\n<https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/03/11/bird-flu-detected-in-flock-of-918000-iowa-hens/>\r\n\r\n\r\nA large commercial flock of egg-laying chickens in southwest Iowa is the 3rd to be infected by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), according to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.\r\n\r\nThe Taylor County flock has 918 873 birds, said Chloe Carson, a spokesperson for the department.\r\n\r\nGov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation Friday [11 Mar 2022] for the county to ensure enough state resources are available to assist the disinfection of the site. Lab tests identified the virus on Thursday [10 Mar 2022], and state agriculture officials have said they attempt to cull all the birds of infected flocks within 24 hours of the virus' confirmation.\r\n\r\nThe virus is very contagious and often deadly to domestic birds.\r\n\r\n\"While this additional case of HPAI is not unexpected, we have prepared for this and are working closely with USDA and livestock producers to control and eradicate this disease from our state,\" said Mike Naig, the state's secretary of agriculture. \"This is a difficult time for poultry producers. We will continue to support them and emphasize the need for strict biosecurity on farms and around poultry to help prevent the spread of this disease.\"\r\n\r\nIt was previously found in Iowa in a flock of 50 000 commercial turkeys on [6 Mar 2022] in Buena Vista County and in a backyard flock of 42 chickens and ducks in Pottawattamie County on [1 Mar 2022].\r\n\r\nState Veterinarian Jeff Kaisand has said the likely source of infections of the previous flocks were wild birds carrying the virus without showing signs.\r\n\r\nThe Taylor County flock is the 2nd-largest to be infected by the virus in the country this year [2022], according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nAn outbreak in 2015 led to the culling of more than 30 million birds in Iowa.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Jared Strong]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[5] Kansas (Franklin County) and Illinois (McLean County): non-commercial flocks\r\nDate: Sat 12 Mar 2022\r\nSource: APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) [edited]\r\n<https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2022/hpai-ks-il>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a backyard mixed species poultry flock in Franklin County, Kansas and a non-commercial backyard flock (non-poultry) in Mclean County, Illinois.\r\n\r\nSamples from the Kansas flock were tested at the Kansas State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and samples from the Illinois flock were tested at the University of Illinois Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Both laboratories are part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. The samples were confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.\r\n\r\nAPHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in both states on joint incident responses. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system.\r\n\r\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] is recommended as a general food safety precaution.\r\n\r\nAs part of existing avian influenza response plans, Federal and State partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.\r\n\r\nAnyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at <https://bit.ly/3I6Xcdz>.\r\n\r\nUSDA will report these findings to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. OIE trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region that pose a risk of spreading disease of concern. OIE trade guidelines also call on member countries to not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to notifications in non-poultry.\r\n\r\nAPHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and backyard flocks detected in a State but will not announce subsequent detections in the State. All cases in commercial and backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at <https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai>.\r\n\r\nIn addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to State/Federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS' toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. APHIS urges producers to consider bringing birds indoors, when possible, to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs that must be depopulated during a disease response. APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at <http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov>.\r\n\r\nAdditional background:\r\nAvian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus which can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or \"H\" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or \"N\" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of \"H\" and \"N\" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains which circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high) -- the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[Be cautious of where you visit. Visiting a poultry house, or a pond where birds are means you could track the virus back to your birds. Avian influenza not only flies into an area on wild birds but can be tracked from location to location by people and vehicles. \r\n\r\nGuard your birds in every way possible. Increase your biosecurity by simple things like changing footwear and coveralls, and instituting foot baths prior to entering a barn. Blow your nose and deposit the tissue in a sealed trash reciprocal, and repeat the process when leaving the barn. \r\n\r\nIf you can keep your birds inside and away from wild birds and visitors, this would be best. This virus continues to cause havoc in poultry of all types, and commercial and private flocks. - Mod.TG\n\nProMED maps:\nSouth Dakota, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701962,243>\nDelaware, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701962,211>\nMaryland, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701962,223>\nMissouri, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701962,227>\nIowa, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701962,218>\nKansas, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701962,219>\nIllinois, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701962,67949>]\n\n[See Also:\nAvian influenza (65): Americas (Canada, USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220311.8701931\r\nAvian influenza (62): Americas (USA) poultry 20220308.8701868\r\nAvian influenza (53): Americas (USA) wild bird, poultry, HPAI H5N1 20220225.8701648\r\nAvian influenza (50): Americas (Canada, USA) poultry, mixed flock, wild bird, HPAI 20220221.8701557\r\nAvian influenza (45): Americas (USA) poultry, mixed flock, HPAI H5N1 20220215.8701469\r\nAvian influenza (43): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220214.8701447\r\nAvian influenza (41): Americas (USA) poultry, HPAI H5N1, OIE 20220211.8701404\r\nAvian influenza (40): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220210.8701387\r\nAvian influenza (39): Americas (USA) turkey, HPAI H5N1 20220209.8701372\r\nAvian influenza (36): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220208.8701339\r\nAvian influenza (32): Americas (Canada) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220202.8701217\r\nAvian influenza (30): Americas (USA) wild bird 20220201.8701178\r\nAvian influenza (22): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220120.8700990\r\nAvian influenza (19): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5, OIE 20220117.8700932\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (39): USA (SC) poultry, HPAI H7N3 20200410.7206731\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (79): USA (TN): poultry, HPAI H7N9 20170317.4908223\r\nAvian influenza (78): USA poultry, (AL) H7, (TN) H7N9, both LPAI 20170317.4906690\r\nAvian influenza (71): USA (WI) turkey, HPAI H7N9 20170311.4893871\r\nAvian influenza (69): USA (TN) poultry, HPAI H7N9 20170309.4888517\r\nAvian influenza (67): USA (TN) poultry, HPAI H7, OIE 20170307.4883078\r\nAvian influenza (66): USA (TN) poultry, HPAI, H7 20170305.4881365\r\n2016\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (15): USA (IN) poultry, HPAI & LPAI H7N8 20160121.3953508\r\nAvian influenza (11): USA (IN) poultry, HPAI/LPAI H7N8 20160120.3950429\r\nAvian influenza (08): USA (IN) poultry, HPAI revised to LPAI H7N8, update 20160118.3944747\r\n2015\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (164): USA (GA) HPAI H5N2, poultry, proactive prevention 20150620.3452030\r\nAvian influenza (151): USA (MN,IA) HPAI H5N2, poultry 20150606.3414670\r\nAvian influenza (141): USA: (MN) HPAI H5N2, poultry 20150531.3397688\r\nAvian influenza (120): USA, HPAI H5N2, poultry, turkey 20150510.3352747\r\nAvian influenza (87): USA, HPAI H5N2, turkey, poultry 20150418.3305689\r\nAvian influenza (80): USA, HPAI H5N2, turkey, poultry 20150415.3298419\r\nAvian influenza (74): USA (MN,ND) HPAI H5N2, turkey 20150412.3292191\r\nAvian influenza (59): USA (MN): turkey, H5N2 20150329.3264089]\n.................................................sb/tg/may/jh"

There are 2 cases reported in 2021.\r\n\u2022 The GPEI is extremely concerned about the unfolding effects of the current crisis in Ukraine on the country's health system. A functioning health system must be kept neutral and protected from all political or security issues affecting countries, to ensure that people have continued access to critical and essential care. At the same time, we have seen time and again that large-scale population movements, insecurity and hampered access contribute greatly to the emergence and/or spread of infectious diseases, such as polio.\r\n\u2022 A national supplemental polio immunization campaign targeting nearly 140 000 children throughout Ukraine who had not been vaccinated against polio began on 1 Feb 2022, but is currently paused, as health authorities have shifted focus towards emergency services. Surveillance to detect and report new cases of polio is also disrupted, increasing the risk of undetected spread of the disease among vulnerable populations. The GPEI is working to urgently develop contingency plans to support Ukraine and prevent further spread of polio.\r\n\u2022 The GPEI has a long history of working in a variety of complex environments and will continue to adapt its operations to the reality on the ground, to the degree possible, without compromising on the safety and security of health workers. At the same time, immunization and surveillance is being assessed in neighbouring countries, to minimize the risk and consequences of any potential infectious disease emergence/spread resulting from the current large-scale population movements. It is critical that necessary resources are mobilized and made available to assist with the humanitarian needs, including relief, disease response/prevention efforts both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries.\r\n \r\nYemen\r\n\u2022 No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week.

It would be interesting to see the time table of positive samples... did the ESs pre-date the identification of the AFP case (the answer seems to be yes reading between the lines) and did the positive ESs in the Palestinian Authority precede, follow or were basically chronologically the same? \r\n\r\nAccording to the Polio Eradication Initiative website, as of 1 Mar 2022 there had only been 2 countries reporting isolation of cVDPV3 since 2016 - China (positive ES 25 Jan 2021) and Somalia (positive AFP case 7 Sep 2018). Unless there has been undetected circulation in those countries for 1 and 3 years, respectively, it is highly likely this virus is a new outbreak in the region. \r\n\r\nOther information not mentioned is whether the cVDPV3 isolates in the Palestinian Authority are genetically related to those identified in Israel. \r\n\r\nA map showing Israel and the Palestinian Authority can be found at: <https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/israel_map.htm>.\r\n\r\nA map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at <https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/>.

The girl had developed acute flaccid paralysis and upon testing of her stool, poliovirus was confirmed. Further testing of the poliovirus isolated from the girl revealed genetic links to VDPV3-strains detected in environmental samples collected from sites in in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory between September 2021 and January 2022. These isolates, previously classified as ambiguous VDPV3, have now been reclassified as circulating VDPV3 (cVDPV3). This confirms an outbreak of cVDPV3 in both Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory.\r\n\r\nLocal health authorities are conducting field, epidemiological and virological investigations, to determine more clearly the source and origin of the isolated virus, and potential risk of further spread associated with it.\r\n\r\nExperts from the headquarters, regional and country offices of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partnership, which includes WHO, Rotary International (RI), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization (GAVI), are working together to help ensure an appropriate response and cessation of this outbreak.\r\n\r\nDetection of this cVDPV3 underscores the importance of strong disease surveillance and high population immunity levels, in order to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus introduction or emergence.\r\n\r\nThe GPEI partnership urges all health authorities to enhance surveillance for poliovirus and implement enhanced vaccination response to prevent further transmission, so that no child is at risk of lifelong paralysis from a disease that can so easily be prevented. GPEI is committed to assisting the health authorities in their efforts to stop the cVDPV3 outbreak.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Our thanks to Helen Branswell for alerting us to the identification of cVDPV3 as the causative virus in this event.

JEV is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito to people and animals -- mostly pigs and horses.\r\n\r\nSunPork Group CEO and managing director Dr Robert van Barneveld said several of their sites in the eastern states had been impacted and they were working through it. \"One of the Goondiwindi farms has been infected...we have an infected premises in New South Wales.... There are infected premises all down the east coast,\" Dr van Barneveld said. \"We've been working on this endlessly since Friday night [25 Feb 2022] when we first were made aware that it was an issue.\"\r\n\r\nDr van Barneveld said it was not a new occurrence and there was no cause for alarm in the pork industry. \"The piggeries are innocent bystanders. Pigs are not going to infect other pigs. It's not going to have a negative effect at an abattoir. The pork is safe to eat. It's play on,\" he said. \"If you're going to have an emergency animal disease, this is the one to have. We're not actually anticipating any significant disruption to our operations at all.\"\r\n\r\nPigs are the focus from a human health perspective, as they can infect mosquitoes that can then infect humans. This is not the case with horses.\r\n\r\nHumans can become infected with JEV through the bite of an infected mosquito. The virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and it cannot be caught through eating pork or pig products.\r\n\r\n\"If a mosquito bites people and if it bites horses, they're called dead-end hosts, so it doesn't pass on. If it bites a pig -- a pig's an amplifier -- so if another mosquito bites that pig while it's viremic, which is a very short period of time, it can transmit in the mosquito population,\" Dr van Barneveld said. \"That's why there are controls around the movement of pigs.\"\r\n\r\nDr van Barneveld said authorities were working well together to protect humans and animals. \"This is about protecting people and the bad guy in the process is a mosquito and the weather patterns,\" he said. \"The state health departments and the state chief veterinary officers have worked extremely well together. They understand that eradicating it is going to be very unlikely and they're being very practical around the movement of pigs and making sure people are safe.\"\r\n\r\nHe said SunPork had done a lot of preparedness work around African swine fever and had good relationships with the state chief veterinary officers which puts it in a very good position to manage this. \"When you get a disease like this, there are a whole stack of legislative instruments that are pushed into place that have to be executed, and they're following those processes. Everyone's fairly calm about it and [I] think we can manage through it with minimal disruption.\"\r\n\r\nA vaccine for horses and pigs is available in countries where the disease is endemic, but no JE vaccines for animals are registered for use in Australia, and there is no effective treatment for JE in animals.\r\n\r\nOn Friday [4 Mar 2022], Australia's Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Mark Schipp said JEV had been confirmed at 14 piggeries across NSW, SA, Queensland and Victoria. This follows a confirmed human case of JEV in Queensland. Queensland Health said the confirmed case had recent travel in regional southern Queensland and is currently being treated in a Brisbane hospital.\r\n\r\nLess than 1% of people infected may develop a serious illness such as encephalitis and experience symptoms including neck stiffness, severe headache and coma, and more rarely, permanent neurological complications or death.\r\n\r\nGoondiwindi and District Veterinary Services owner and vet Dr Trisha Pullos said the recent heavy rain in parts of Queensland and NSW had brought with it more mosquitoes and potentially more risk of JEV. \"We've had quite a bit of rain like everybody else, and the mozzies out here are brutal,\" Dr Pullos said.\r\n\r\nDr Pullos said the main issues were observed in piglets -- pigs didn't seem to be affected physically. \"If the piglets are born dead or weak or malformed or something really unusual or if the sow aborts the whole litter -- that's the 1st sign,\" she said. \"Pigs can amplify the virus. It's not transferable between humans; it seems to be just the mosquitoes that are how we can catch it, so if you can keep the mozzies off you, then we'll be a little bit safer.\"\r\n\r\nShe said it was important to get information from reliable sources and anyone who was worried should contact their vet. \"Anybody who's got 2 pigs in the backyard, or a pig for the kids, or a little kill herd at the back of the property -- they need to contact their local vet and just say, 'Hey, I've got 2 pigs here. What do I need to keep an eye out for?' Then what we'll do is we'll let our district vet know who will then let the Chief Veterinary Officer know so we can try and track it a lot faster, because if someone goes and tells their neighbour but doesn't tell the vet then we're already behind the 8 ball.\"\r\n\r\nShe said there was a risk people had \"bad news fatigue\" and wouldn't take things seriously. \"I've found that everyone's a little bit worn out. There's been quite a few comments on our Facebook posts where people are just like, 'Not again', or 'What now?' 'Can it just end?' We might be at risk of going, 'Oh, whatever', and I want to make sure that they're not going to do that.\"\r\n\r\nJEV was detected in 3 people in the Torres Strait Islands in 1995. In 1998, 2 further cases were detected in people in Queensland, including one acquired on the Australian mainland.\r\n\r\nJEV is mostly transmitted by bites from infected mosquito vectors and is maintained in mosquito-waterbird or mosquito-waterbird-pig cycles. Waterbirds, particularly wading birds such as herons and egrets, are the main source from which transmission of JEV can occur. They are important amplifying hosts and hold enough virus in their blood to infect vectors for one to 7 days.\r\n\r\nPigs are also major amplifiers of the virus and develop levels of virus in the blood sufficient to infect vectors for around 4 days. Horses and a wide range of other species may be infected but do not develop levels of virus in the blood sufficient to infect mosquitoes, so are not involved in maintaining disease in an area.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Brandon Long]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] South Australia: pigs\r\nDate: Sun 6 Mar 2022 23:58 ACDT\r\nSource: ABC News [edited]\r\n<https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2022-03-07/japanese-encephalitis-outbreak-reaches-sa/100888042>\r\n\r\n\r\nKey points\r\n----------\r\n- The virus has been detected at 21 piggeries, 3 human cases have been confirmed, and the federal government predicts more cases will be detected.\r\n- The Chief Veterinary Officer says it's unusual to detect Japanese encephalitis (JE) so far south.\r\n- Pork SA [South Australia] says piggeries will still be able to operate, but restrictions are in place.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of Japanese encephalitis (JE) is now impacting 4 states as public health officials work to contain it. Since the potentially fatal mosquito-borne virus was first detected near the New South Wales-Victoria border last week, cases have been recorded in Queensland and South Australia.\r\n\r\nA Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment spokesperson said 3 cases of JE had been confirmed in humans, and a number of possible cases were under investigation. The spokesperson said it was anticipated that more cases would be confirmed shortly.\r\n\r\nAustralia's Chief Veterinary Officer Mark Schipp said animals at 21 piggeries had been infected. \"We're mapping the presence of waterbirds, feral pigs or piggeries and people that have contracted the infection,\" he said. \"We're undertaking mosquito surveillance and mosquito control on those farms.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a vaccine available as well. \"That's the purpose of the mapping that we're undertaking at the moment -- to prioritise those vaccinations and then rolling the vaccinations out further from there,\" Mr Schipp said. The movement of pigs on farms with positive cases is being restricted.\r\n\r\nPork SA chairman Andrew Johnson is urging pork producers to report suspected cases. \"Farmers that see any symptoms, they shouldn't be afraid to advise accordingly,\" he said.\r\n\r\nJE cannot be transmitted to humans by eating pork products and producers will still be able to transport livestock to abattoirs. \"If there's a suspect case, or if there is a positive case, those farms will be issued a movement permit that will allow them to continue business,\" Mr Johnson said.\r\n\r\nThe virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and cannot be passed from livestock to humans. \"Japanese encephalitis is a virus carried by mosquitoes from water birds or pigs to humans or horses,\" Mr Schipp said. \"Pigs are an amplifying host, so they produce a lot of virus and the mosquitoes pick that up and carry it forward into humans and horses.\"\r\n\r\nJE is not normally found in Australia and health officials survey the Torres Strait and the Top End every year to check for outbreaks. This outbreak has been found along the Murray River corridor.\r\n\r\nMr Schipp said it was surprising to find JE so far south. \"It will have a large impact on human health and industry,\" he said. \"The impacts on tourism, for example, could be significant. We're doing everything we can to try and minimise its spread and ensure that people are vaccinated.\"\r\n\r\n[Byline: Megan Hughes]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Pigs have been effective sentinels for the presence of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in the 4 affected Australian states. The above reports provide a comprehensive overview of the current JEV situation in the 4 states. There has been no indication in the above or previous reports that ProMED has received about the frequency of aborted litters or teratogenic effects in the affected piggeries. Restriction on movement of pigs out of infected piggeries could be a problem for producers. The Australian response is a good example of implementation of a One Health approach to an unexpected disease outbreak.

They appear more in urban environments and have become adapted to reproduce in small water collection sites generated by people.\r\n\r\nThey usually bite during the day and not at night and their bite generates a strong inflammatory reaction that is accompanied by a great irritation. They move nimbly close to the ground and no buzzing is heard.\r\n\r\nThe female mosquitoes are the ones that bite, since they need to feed on blood to reproduce. They also need water as breeding sites to complete their development. They lay their eggs in the water, from which the larvae emerge, then transform into pupae (both are aquatic) and finally become adult mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nMosquitoes that bite humans need to be breeding very close to people. That is why the most effective measure against them is to monitor or eliminate their breeding sites.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this report.\r\n\r\nThis is yet another example of movement of _Aedes aegypti_ to a new location.

One hopes that surveillance and response will continue to be successful in preventing the establishment of this mosquito or others in the Canary Islands. - Mod.TY]\n\n[See Also:\n2017\r\n----\r\nInvasive mosquito - Spain: (CN) 20171214.5503487]\n.................................................jh/ty/mj/jh"

This is the state's 1st confirmed case of HPAI since 2015.\r\n\r\n\"While Nebraska has not seen HPAI in a backyard or commercial poultry flock within the state this year [2022], the finding of this single goose adds Nebraska to a long list of states with confirmed cases of HPAI,\" said State Veterinarian Dr. Roger Dudley. \"Infected wild birds can carry the disease to new areas when migrating, so we encourage backyard poultry and commercial poultry flocks to continue to remain vigilant, practice good biosecurity and report sick or dying birds immediately.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska Department of Agriculture and the Kansas Department of Agriculture's (KDA) Division of Animal Health encourage poultry owners to take steps to protect their commercial and backyard flocks from avian influenza by monitoring their birds for symptoms and by implementing biosecurity practices.\r\n\r\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza is a highly contagious viral disease that can infect chickens, turkeys, and other birds and can cause severe illness and/or sudden death. HPAI has been identified in backyard flocks as well as commercial operations in neighboring states; it has not been detected in Kansas.\r\n\r\n\"Protecting the poultry in the state is a high priority, and we need all poultry owners to be part of the effort to prevent the spread of disease in Kansas,\" said Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith. \"Our best defense is to follow strict biosecurity practices and vigilantly monitor birds for any signs of illness.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. Avian influenza does not present a food safety risk. Poultry and eggs are safe to eat when handled and cooked properly.\r\n\r\nAs part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock. The United States has the strongest avian influenza surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.\r\n\r\nFor more information about HPAI, including current status of the confirmed cases in other states as well as more information about biosecurity for your flock, go to the KDA's avian influenza webpage at <agriculture.ks.gov/AvianInfluenza> or call 785-564-6601.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[ProMED map of Nebraska, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701931,23160>\r\nNebraska county map: <https://geology.com/county-map/nebraska-county-map.gif>]\r\n\r\n******\r\nCanada\r\n[3] New Brunswick (Albert County): great black-backed gull\r\nDate: Wed 9 Mar 2022 16:05 AST\r\nSource: Global News [edited]\r\n<https://globalnews.ca/news/8670483/avian-flu-new-brunswick-black-backed-gull/>\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Brunswick has detected a case of the avian flu in a great black-backed gull in the Riverview area [Albert County]. In a release, the province's Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development said the Canadian Wildlife Service confirmed the bird had tested positive for the highly-pathogenic avian influenza, also known as H5N1.\r\n\r\nThe strain of avian flu, which is a viral infection that can spread easily among birds, has been detected in every Atlantic province.\r\n\r\nThe release said there are several different types of avian influenza. Some wild bird species, like ducks, might carry the virus and infect other birds without getting sick themselves. Meanwhile, other wild or domestic bird species can become severely ill or die after infection.\r\n\r\n\"Although the chances of people getting sick from avian influenza are extremely low, people who work around birds should take extra care,\" the release said.\r\n\r\nThose who encounter a sick or dead bird should contact the Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development at 1-833-301-0334, the release said.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Alex Cooke]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n[ProMED map of New Brunswick, Canada: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701931,17394>\r\nNew Brunswick county map: <https://www.123rf.com/photo_23993023_new-brunswick-administrative-map.html>\r\n\r\nThe Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 in the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. The current propagation of H5N1 in the Americas seems to be associated with the Atlantic Americas flyway, although the finding of an infected wild goose in Nebraska shows that the virus is already moving westward.\r\n\r\nIt is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that they are poor spreaders and instead may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. - Mod.PMB]\n\n[See Also:\nAvian influenza (62): Americas (USA) poultry 20220308.8701868\r\nAvian influenza (53): Americas (USA) wild bird, poultry, HPAI H5N1 20220225.8701648\r\nAvian influenza (50): Americas (Canada, USA) poultry, mixed flock, wild bird, HPAI 20220221.8701557\r\nAvian influenza (45): Americas (USA) poultry, mixed flock, HPAI H5N1 20220215.8701469\r\nAvian influenza (43): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220214.8701447\r\nAvian influenza (41): Americas (USA) poultry, HPAI H5N1, OIE 20220211.8701404\r\nAvian influenza (40): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220210.8701387\r\nAvian influenza (39): Americas (USA) turkey, HPAI H5N1 20220209.8701372\r\nAvian influenza (36): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220208.8701339\r\nAvian influenza (32): Americas (Canada) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220202.8701217\r\nAvian influenza (30): Americas (USA) wild bird 20220201.8701178\r\nAvian influenza (22): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220120.8700990\r\nAvian influenza (19): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5, OIE 20220117.8700932\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (39): USA (SC) poultry, HPAI H7N3 20200410.7206731\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (79): USA (TN): poultry, HPAI H7N9 20170317.4908223\r\nAvian influenza (78): USA poultry, (AL) H7, (TN) H7N9, both LPAI 20170317.4906690\r\nAvian influenza (71): USA (WI) turkey, HPAI H7N9 20170311.4893871\r\nAvian influenza (69): USA (TN) poultry, HPAI H7N9 20170309.4888517\r\nAvian influenza (67): USA (TN) poultry, HPAI H7, OIE 20170307.4883078\r\nAvian influenza (66): USA (TN) poultry, HPAI, H7 20170305.4881365\r\n2016\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (15): USA (IN) poultry, HPAI & LPAI H7N8 20160121.3953508\r\nAvian influenza (11): USA (IN) poultry, HPAI/LPAI H7N8 20160120.3950429\r\nAvian influenza (08): USA (IN) poultry, HPAI revised to LPAI H7N8, update 20160118.3944747\r\n2015\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (164): USA (GA) HPAI H5N2, poultry, proactive prevention 20150620.3452030\r\nAvian influenza (151): USA (MN,IA) HPAI H5N2, poultry 20150606.3414670\r\nAvian influenza (141): USA: (MN) HPAI H5N2, poultry 20150531.3397688\r\nAvian influenza (120): USA, HPAI H5N2, poultry, turkey 20150510.3352747\r\nAvian influenza (87): USA, HPAI H5N2, turkey, poultry 20150418.3305689\r\nAvian influenza (80): USA, HPAI H5N2, turkey, poultry 20150415.3298419\r\nAvian influenza (74): USA (MN,ND) HPAI H5N2, turkey 20150412.3292191\r\nAvian influenza (59): USA (MN): turkey, H5N2 20150329.3264089]\n.................................................sb/pmb/mj/rd/jh"

The MoHS is working with the World Health Organization and other partners and has dispatched rapid response teams to conduct a detailed investigation of the outbreak and plan for a robust and timely response.\r\n\r\nA measles outbreak is defined as 3 or more laboratory-confirmed cases in a community or district within a span of one month.\r\n\r\nOn 19 Oct 2021, the Kambia District Health Management Team (DHMT) was notified by the Bamoi Luma Community Health Centre (CHC) of 3 suspected cases of measles in children aged 3, 5, and 6, residents of Fullah Town and Guinea Park communities within the Bamoi Luma CHC catchment area. The district surveillance unit conducted preliminary investigations including active case search in the surrounding communities leading to the identification and detection of 12 additional suspected cases.

Despite symptomatic treatment with antipyretics, he subsequently experienced hemoconcentration (hematocrit = 60.4% [normal = 38.8%-50%]), thrombocytopenia (<10,000 platelets/\u03bcL [normal = 150,000-450,000]), and acute kidney injury (blood urea nitrogen [BUN] = 95 mg/dL [normal = 9-20] and creatinine = 4.95 mg/dL [normal = 0.66-1.50]) over several days (1). Approximately one week later, he experienced signs consistent with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a potentially fatal systemic inflammatory syndrome, including elevated ferritin, triglycerides, and interleukin-2 levels, and hemophagocytosis cells on bone marrow biopsy (2). Patient A was a maintenance worker with frequent rodent sightings at his workplace. Serology results were positive for hantavirus immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG. Additional tests sent to CDC returned with hantavirus IgG and IgM titers >1:6400, confirming recent infection with Seoul hantavirus (SEOV). Virus isolation was unsuccessful (1). Comprehensive testing for other infectious etiologies returned negative results. The patient responded to supportive treatment and was eventually discharged.\r\n\r\nPatient B, a man aged 37 years with history of chronic kidney disease, 5 months later in November 2018, was evaluated in a DC emergency department with a 3-day history of chills, fever (104 deg F [40.1 deg C]), headache, myalgia, and productive cough, followed later by diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. On further evaluation, he had elevated hepatic transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase = 164 units/L [normal = 3-34], alanine aminotransferase = 78 units/L [normal = 15-41]), thrombocytopenia (43 000/\u03bcL), and acute kidney injury (BUN = 36 mg/dL and creatinine = 7.6 mg/dL) during his admission. The patient worked as a dishwasher and plumber's assistant, had no recent history of travel outside the United States, and did not own any pets. He was unaware of exposure to rodents at work, at home, or during his commute. Serology sent to rule out hemorrhagic fever-renal syndrome returned with IgG and IgM titers of >1:6400, confirming recent infection with SEOV. Comprehensive testing for other infectious etiologies returned negative results. The patient responded to supportive treatment and was eventually discharged.\r\n\r\nSEOV is a type of hantavirus previously associated with hemorrhagic fever-renal syndrome. Patient A is believed to have had the 1st case of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis related to hantavirus infection reported in the United States and the 2nd worldwide (1,3). Past studies have documented that Norway rats [_Rattus norvegicus_] serve as the reservoir species for SEOV in the United States (1,4), and previous cases of hantavirus infection have been linked to wild or pet rodents (4,5). Humans can become infected with SEOV through aerosol exposure to virus shed in rodent feces, saliva, or urine. Rodent overpopulation in DC is well documented by increased complaints via the Citywide Call Center to the Rodent Control Program, and the DC Department of Health has amplified efforts to address this public health threat. Although extremely rare, the 2 SEOV cases presented in this report highlight the importance of physicians including hantavirus infection in their differential diagnoses in patients with compatible symptoms and history of animal exposure or travel and underscore the importance of reporting notifiable infectious disease cases to health departments for investigation and response. These cases also serve as a reminder to the public to minimize risk for infection by following recommended hygiene practices.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n--------------\r\n1.

The occurrence of 2 unrelated SEOV infections in the Washington DC area, but in different localities, in May and November of 2018, is very unusual.\r\n\r\nDr. Jan Clement offered some useful information about SEOV occurrence and diagnosis (see Hantavirus - Americas (07): Panama comment 20210624.8473120). \". . . wild rat-induced SEOV [Seoul virus] infection should be included in each serological investigation of a suspected [hantavirus infection] case, even when admittedly RT-PCR remains the gold standard. However, due to the short duration of SEOV viremia, RT-PCR remains often negative, so that plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) in specialized labs or serology in other labs are often the only solution. Commercial hantavirus tests, however, often lack a diagnostic SEOV antigen, so that cross-reacting other murid hantaviral pathogens often result in the diagnosis of an 'HTNV' [Hantaan virus] or a 'DOBV' [Dobrava virus] infection, even in regions where these pathogens are actually absent.\r\n\r\n\"In an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), murid prototype HTNV 76-118 strongly cross-reacts equally with murid SEOV, and also, mostly to a lesser degree, with arvicolid PUUV [Puumala virus]. Of note, these same IFA cross-reactions allowed, from the early 1980s onward, the start of surprisingly efficient serodiagnosis for Western-European HFRS [hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome], despite being predominantly PUUV-induced, indeed (Clement 2015, Clement et al. 2019). Moreover, in pioneer IFA times, the former prudent circumscription of worldwide omnipresent rat-borne SEOV pathogen was consequently always described as being 'HTNV-like,' like in a few African countries (Clement et al. 2019). However, these same serological cross-reactions bear an implicit warning for developed regions like Finno-Scandia, where sero-diagnoses, until now, often rely on assays containing only PUUV antigens considered (wrongly), since decades, as the sole local hantaviral pathogen. Of note, not a single SEOV-HFRS case was reported so far from Finno-Scandia, despite demonstration, dating from 1989, of SEOV-infection in local rats (LeDuc et al., 1986). The same observation is valid for blatantly absent diagnoses of human SEOV infections hitherto from vast regions like Australia and New Zealand despite, again, the demonstration of SEOV-infected rats already since 1986 (LeDuc et al., 1986).\"\r\n\r\n\"In summary, SEOV is mentioned in virtually each hantavirus paper as the only global hantaviral pathogen but is, in fact, almost never considered in the description of new local HFRS (or HCPS [hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome] cases. Thus, paradoxically enough, it is the only global hantaviral pathogen [that] remains a permanent blind spot in hantavirology.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nClement, J. \"Acute kidney injury and hantavirus disease\" In: Turner N, Lameire N, Goldsmith D, Winearls C, Himmelfarb J, Remuzzi G, editors.

That comes after an oversight committee made up primarily of neurologists from New Brunswick reviewed records from 48 patients who are part of the cluster and found that while some have unusual symptoms, they don't have a common, unknown illness.\r\n\r\n\"The oversight committee has unanimously agreed that these 48 people should never have been identified as having a neurological syndrome of unknown cause and that based on the evidence reviewed, no such syndrome exists,\" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell said on Thursday [24 Feb 2022]. \"Public Health concurs with these findings. But I stress again, this does not mean that these people aren't seriously ill. It means they are ill with a known neurological condition.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee's review found \"potential alternative diagnoses\" for 41 of the 48 patients, including illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, post-concussion syndrome, and cancer. Ten of the 48 patients have died.\r\n\r\nThe oversight committee \"could not conclude that the main referring neurologist had sought 2nd opinions\" for the patients before determining they may be suffering from an unknown illness. The report doesn't mention him by name, but [one physician] identified 46 of 48 patients in the cluster. [He] declined an interview through Vitalite Health Network on Thursday [24 Feb 2022], but in the fall, he told Radio-Canada he stood by his theory.\r\n\r\nIn the future, the committee recommended a 2nd specialist do a review to determine whether a patient has a new and unknown disease. If they don't agree, a board of specialty doctors should review the case. \"This would implement a mechanism of oversight to ensure this due diligence is completed before any further investigations or clustering of cases take place,\" the report says.\r\n\r\nA report from Public Health New Brunswick, also released on Thursday [24 Feb 2022], found shortcomings in the way the province communicated about the potential illness and problems with sharing information between 2 levels of government. \"In retrospect, it is clear the website communications and news releases did not adequately address this anxiety or provide support to patients and their families,\" the report says.\r\n\r\nHealth Minister Dorothy Shephard told reporters that Public Health has suggested changes \"to improve the way potential new diseases are reported and investigated.\"\r\n\r\n\"We also need to take steps to ensure that this doesn't happen again,\" she said. \"The stress and anxiety that these families have experienced should not have occurred.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Howard Njoo, the deputy chief public health officer with the Public Health Agency of Canada, said the federal agency \"supports the investigation's findings that this cluster does not represent a neurological syndrome of unknown cause.\"\r\n\r\nSome patients and their families aren't happy with the committee's findings and plan to continue to push for a scientific investigation that would see the province conduct environmental testing.\r\n\r\nThat group includes [J and TB], who saw their father, [LB], deteriorate rapidly in front of their eyes. He died in 2019, and last year [2021] his family was told he was a member of the cluster of 48. Both were disappointed with what they heard Thursday [24 Feb 2022]. \"The cluster is continuing on; we haven't given up,\" [TB] said.\r\n\r\n[SE] was also told his father, [RE], was a member of the cluster. [SE] said his father continues to decline physically and cognitively, which has driven [SE] to push for answers from the government, organizing other patients and their family members through a Facebook group. \"It's not just the 48; we know it's more than 48,\" [SE] said.\r\n\r\n'A new disease'\r\nLast March [2021], the office of the chief medical officer of health sent a memo to health-care providers across the province, warning them about a \"cluster of progressive neurological syndrome of unknown etiology.\"\r\n\r\n\"Preliminary investigation conducted in late 2019/early 2020 determined this to be a distinct atypical neurological syndrome,\" the memo said, suggesting the province had already done some sort of work to rule out known diseases. \"It most likely is a new disease,\" Russell told reporters on [18 Mar 2021]. \"We haven't seen this anywhere else.\"\r\n\r\nThe size of the cluster grew to at least 48 patients, ranging in age from 18 to 85, before the government stopped adding new patients to the list. Many suffer from debilitating symptoms.\r\n\r\nAsked about her comments last March [2021], Russell said she is \"much more confident\" with the conclusion public health officials have reached now, noting that members of the oversight committee spent 2-4 hours with each case file. \"To have that many specialists involved, our epidemiologist team and our work with the Public Health Agency of Canada, I certainly am not infallible in terms of coming to the hypothesis that I did a year ago,\" she said.\r\n\r\nProvince halted expert meetings\r\nThe province consulted experts, including many from beyond New Brunswick's borders, last year [2021] to try to find answers to what could be causing patients' symptoms. Some [experts] had expertise in environmental health, others in neurological illness. But that all changed last May [2021], when the province stopped meeting with those experts, drawing questions and criticism from some patients in the cluster and their families.\r\n\r\nSoon after, the language that officials like Shephard used to describe the syndrome became more uncertain, using words such as \"potential.\" The province launched its own investigation and formed the committee that wrote Thursday's [24 Feb 2022] report.\r\n\r\nA report released by the province in the fall found no specific behaviours, foods, or environmental exposures that linked the patients together and could pose a risk.\r\n\r\nOn that same day [24 Feb 2022], Shephard said 8 patients who had died, including 6 who were part of the original cluster of 48, had autopsy results indicating they died from known diseases, such as cancer, Lewy body dementia, and Alzheimer's disease.\r\n\r\nAt the time, [the neurologist], who treated most of the patients who are part of the cluster, stood behind his theory of a new illness.\r\n\r\n\"We had 3 field epidemiologists working full time for 3 weeks each, for instance, besides having dozens of meetings with experts to analyze the data and to come up with the conclusion that there is a pattern here and that pattern is new,\" [the neurologist] said in an interview with Radio-Canada in October [2021].\r\n\r\n[Byline: Karissa Donkin]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for sending a similar article on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe above article summarizes the conclusions of the expert review committee that was designated for the task: \"The oversight committee has unanimously agreed that these 48 people should never have been identified as having a neurological syndrome of unknown cause and that based on the evidence reviewed, no such syndrome exists.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee also ruled out the possibility of a 'common illness' among the 48 cases, citing, \"It means they are ill with a known neurological condition.\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the committee concluded that there could be \"possible alternative diagnoses for 41 of the 48 patients, including Alzheimer's disease, various forms of dementia, post-concussion syndrome, and cancer.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems rather circumstantial that 41 of the 48 cases, as cited above, had alternative diagnoses in the same timeframe, as they all presented with neurological symptoms that were reviewed by the local neurologist as well as investigated by epidemiologists. The recommendation for review of all future cases by 2 neuro-physicians can be helpful in finding definitive diagnoses and appropriate management in a timely manner. However, some cases remain unexplained, and future reviews are merited in case new cases emerge and to inspire public confidence. - Mod.UBA]\r\n\r\n[A similar article was published in the Washington Post on 24 Feb 2022 (<https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/24/new-brunswick-mystery-brain-disease/>). Both the CBC and the Washington Post are painting a picture of questioning the results of this investigation. In January 2022, an article in the Guardian (UK) said that there may be as many as 150 cases in New Brunswick and mentioned that many cases were in a younger-than-expected age group (<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/neurological-illness-affecting-young-adults-canada>).  A key unanswered concern relates to environmental studies.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of the investigation and other official documents can be found at <https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/health/neuro-cluster.html>.\r\n\r\nI suspect we haven't heard the end of this. - Mod.MPP\r\n\r\nProMED map of New Brunswick Province, Canada: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701652,269>]\n\n[See Also:\n2021\r\n----\r\nUndiagnosed neurological illness - Canada (03): (NB) updates 20210612.8433060\r\nUndiagnosed neurological illness - Canada (02): (NB) RFI 20210506.8347534\r\nUndiagnosed neurological illness - Canada: (NB) fatal, RFI 20210323.8256422]\n.................................................uba/may/mpp/uba/mpp/tw/mpp"

It was slower to launch its COVID-19 vaccination campaigns than other European countries, and while the government encouraged citizens to get immunized, most people struggled to find a way to get the shot, didn't feel the need to get vaccinated, or didn't trust the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.\r\n\r\nJust before the invasion on 24 Feb 2022, only 35% of the Ukrainian population had been vaccinated. That puts it in line with most of its neighboring countries, although some, including Poland and Hungary, have achieved higher vaccination coverage. While different health systems and varying attitudes about vaccination in those countries are contributing to those contrasting rates, Ukraine's relatively low vaccination rate could have implications for how large additional surges of cases, both in the country and in the region become as a result of the war. Like many other countries, Ukraine experienced a surge in cases due to the omicron variant in November [2021] and another peak in the 1st week of February [2022] -- most likely due to its low level of vaccination. By the middle of February, 60% of COVID-19 tests conducted in the country were positive.\r\n\r\nSuch low vaccine coverage isn't enough to control a highly transmissible virus like SARS-CoV-2, say public health experts. Add in a war -- with the political and social upheaval it causes -- and not only are spikes in infections inevitable, but there is also the potential for new variants to emerge, which puts the whole world at risk.\r\n\r\nVaccination and mitigation measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and basic hygiene are critical for curbing spread of SARS-CoV-2, but are impossible to maintain when a country is under siege. The humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders has been distributing trauma kits and training healthcare providers in Mariupol, Ukraine -- a target of the Russian attack -- as well as providing shelter and basic health needs for those crossing the border into other countries like Poland. But it's not enough.\r\n\r\n\"War is an infectious disease's best friend,\" says Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. \"It challenges every public health program you can possibly have. It limits the medical care available for those who might be seriously ill, and often fosters transmission when so many people are crowded into bomb shelter locations and on trains. This is going to be the perfect storm of one serious challenge after another.\"\r\n\r\nA decade and a half ago, World Health Organization researchers found that 65% of major infectious disease outbreaks occurring in the 1990s were among refugee populations or in conflict zones. Les Roberts, professor emeritus of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health who has spent time in war zones addressing outbreaks, notes that these populations are especially vulnerable to viral diseases like COVID-19. \"It turns out when you are under stress, your immune system does not work as well. You are not eating as well, and you cannot fight disease as well,\" he says. \"And in times of conflict, you move around a lot, and end up in bomb shelters or basements or on trucks that are way more crowded than normal and have bad air circulation. I don't think people fully understand how war is like the breeding ground of disease.\"\r\n\r\nMore than 670 000 people have left Ukraine since the war began, and this increased travel will almost certainly lead to a spike in cases in the country and those bordering it -- like Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, and Moldova -- while straining their healthcare systems. Health experts are particularly concerned about the situation in Poland, where almost half of the Ukrainians have fled, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. \"SARS-CoV-2 spreads like lightning right now,\" says Jeffrey Shaman, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. \"For places like Poland and places in western Ukraine where people are fleeing, there is enormous opportunity for this virus to do damage that it wouldn't have had the opportunity to do otherwise.\" Prior to the influx, nearly 60% of Poland's population was vaccinated, which will help protect it against a surge, but new infections will likely spike there as well, increasing demand for healthcare services.\r\n\r\nWhat's truly needed is a global coordinating body for public health, Toner says, which isn't likely, given challenges posed by issues of national sovereignty. But the principles behind global coordination might still be implemented in more limited ways.\r\n\r\nThe global vaccination distribution program COVAX, through which developed nations purchase vaccines in order to drive prices down for developing countries, represented such an effort, but is falling short of meeting its promise. It failed to deliver the 2 billion doses it had guaranteed by the end of 2021, and the group estimates that it will take until well into 2023 to provide enough vaccines to immunize the world. \"After the pandemic is over, I think we need to take a real look into COVAX and why it didn't work as well as we had hoped, and what we could have done to make it better,\" says Toner.\r\n\r\nSome public health experts have proposed alternatives, like supporting vaccine makers to set up manufacturing facilities in countries that have historically struggled to get the latest vaccines, as well as encouraging more shared intellectual property to enable poorer countries to access the technology they need to produce shots on their own.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Alice Park]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n[Hospitals have become targets, exacerbating care for the wounded and sick. The repercussions of this war on the spread of infectious diseases in the population of Ukraine and neighboring countries are going to be severe. But that is just one of the tragedies facing the people, whose lives are threatened and who will need to find sustenance and clean water to keep them alive.

Risk of severe COVID-19 from the delta and omicron variants in relation to vaccination status, sex, age and comorbidities -- surveillance results from southern Sweden, July 2021 to January 2022. Euro Surveill. 2022; 27(9): pii=2200121; <https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.9.2200121>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant of concern (VOC) omicron (Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak (Pango) lineage designation B.1.1.529) was first reported in South Africa on 24 Nov 2021 and has since spread rapidly worldwide. In a comparison of secondary attack rates within Danish households, protection against infection among vaccinated persons was lower if the index case was infected with omicron rather than delta (B.1.617.2) (1 [see source URL for complete references]). Similarly, a Canadian study, using a test-negative design, found that 2 doses of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine did not protect against omicron infection, while a 3rd dose provided some immediate protection but still substantially less than against delta (2). However, available evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccination still provides high protection against severe disease from omicron (3-5). A Danish cohort study among infected individuals found a substantially lower risk of hospitalisation after omicron infection compared with delta among both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals (4). A limitation in that study was that it included few infections in older age-groups, especially among the unvaccinated. To what extent the omicron variant leads to severe disease in unvaccinated populations, older persons and people with underlying conditions thus merits further investigation.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the present study was to monitor omicron risks in risk groups defined by sex, age and comorbidities in addition to vaccination status. The study was conducted in Scania, southern Sweden, an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse region exceeding 1.3 million inhabitants and with local variation in vaccination coverage between 40% and 90% among adults.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: We observed markedly lower risks of severe disease among the vaccinated, i.e., cases who had received at least 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine irrespective of vaccine type, during the period when the SARS-CoV-2 omicron VOC dominated. The VE [vaccine effectiveness] thus remained high but changed in nature from protection against both infection and severe disease from delta to protection only against severe disease from omicron. The risk of severe disease was also generally lower for unvaccinated cases during the omicron period, but remained high among older people and middle-aged men with comorbidities. Omicron thus remains a genuine public health concern in countries, populations and subgroups with low vaccination uptake.\r\n\r\nConclusion: While the SARS-CoV-2 omicron VOC rarely leads to severe disease in vaccinated persons, first-time infection can still cause severe disease in unvaccinated persons with advanced age or underlying illnesses. Efforts to increase vaccination uptake across countries, populations and subgroups should thus remain a public health priority.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] Blood type, other blood proteins\r\nDate: Thu 3 Mar 2022\r\nSource: MedPage Today [edited]\r\n<https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/97486>\r\n\r\n\r\nEleven blood markers, including the ABO protein that determines blood group, were implicated in severe COVID outcomes in a genomic analysis of clinical data. After examining more than 3000 blood proteins against those found in hospitalized and severe COVID cases, 6 proteins had a causal link with increased risk of hospitalization and 5 proteins were linked to COVID-related need for respiratory support, death, or both, with odds ratios ranging from 1.12 to 1.35.\r\n\r\nAnother 17 blood proteins had a causal association with reduced risk of severe COVID, reported Alish Palmos, PhD, of King's College London, and colleagues in PLoS Genetics. Palmos' group noted that this is the 1st study to examine such a large number of proteins to determine their connection to COVID severity.\r\n\r\n\"What we have done...is provide a shortlist for the next stage of research,\" said co-author Gerome Breen, PhD, also of King's College London, in a statement. These data \"present a potentially important avenue for further research to better understand the mechanisms behind COVID-19 with an ultimate aim of developing new treatments but potentially also preventative therapies.\"\r\n\r\nSpecifically, they highlighted that the ABO protein was implicated in severe COVID, which suggests that blood groups play a key role in people developing severe disease. \"Our study does not link precise blood group with risk of severe COVID-19, but since previous research has found that proportion of people who are group A is higher in COVID-19-positive individuals, this suggests that blood group A is a more likely candidate for follow-up studies,\" said co-author Christopher H\u00fcbel, PhD, also of King's College London, in a statement.\r\n\r\nThe authors noted how difficult it is to examine the role of \"immunomodulatory blood proteins\" without accounting for a host of clinical confounders in patients with severe COVID, such as initial viral exposure, smoking status and BMI, all of which may contribute to \"high pro-inflammatory cytokine levels.\"\r\n\r\nThey examined data from several sources, including from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to identify blood proteins. Palmos' team then looked at the COVID-19 Host Genome Initiative GWAS meta-analysis of individuals hospitalized due to COVID symptoms vs controls and its comparison of \"very severe respiratory confirmed COVID vs the population,\" which examined hospitalized individuals who needed respiratory support or died from COVID vs controls. All used a European sample.\r\n\r\nPalmos' group identified 6 blood markers that were \"significantly casually associated\" with COVID-related hospitalization, with an increase in odds of hospitalization ranging from 7% to 19%, the authors wrote. Notably, fatty acid hydrolase 2 (FAAH2) had the strongest association (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.25).\r\n\r\nFive proteins were linked to an increased need for respiratory support, death from COVID, or both, with an increase in odds of severe outcomes ranging from 12% to 35%. Glucosaminyl (N-Acetyl) transferase 4 (GCNT4) had the strongest association (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.26-1.44).\r\n\r\nThe authors also identified 9 proteins linked to a relative 7% to 20% decreased risk of COVID-related hospitalization. Likewise, 8 blood markers were associated with a lower risk of severe COVID, ranging from an 11% to a 27% decrease. In both instances, the strongest association was for platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1; OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73-0.87 and OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63-0.83, respectively).\r\n\r\nHowever, they added that their analysis did not identify \"typical canonical immune proteins,\" such as interleukin 6 or C-reactive protein, which \"suggests that with a larger database of proteins, we can pinpoint non-canonical immunomodulatory proteins relevant to disease pathophysiology.\"\r\n\r\nAdditional limitations included the possibility of false-positive associations due to the Mendelian randomization analysis methodology used; that some blood markers were excluded due to unavailability, which would miss associations between these markers; and that other GWAS might have been better for identifying severe COVID phenotypes, although not available at the time of the study.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Molly Walker]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n[The citation and author summary of the PLoS Genetics report discussed above follow:\r\nPalmos AB, Millischer V, Menon DK, et al.

Although vaccinations provide good protection, it is important to fully understand the biology behind the severe forms of COVID-19. Mendelian randomization facilitates the identification of blood proteins that may be involved in the pathophysiology of severe forms. Here, we investigated whether >3000 blood proteins might play a role in hospitalization due to COVID-19 or the requirement of respiratory support or death due to COVID-19. Using genetic instruments and under the assumption of Mendelian randomization, our results are consistent with higher levels of 5 proteins being causally associated with an increased risk of both COVID-19 outcomes and higher levels of one protein associated with hospitalization. Our results are also consistent with higher levels of 4 proteins -- mainly playing a role in cell adhesion -- being causally associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization and respiratory support/death, and higher levels of 4 proteins being causally associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization. These proteins may represent new biomarkers useful in risk prediction of severity and may lead to new therapeutics by prioritizing druggable targets.\" - Mod.LK]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[4] WHO: daily new cases reported (as of 3 Mar 2022)\r\nDate: Thu 3 Mar 2022\r\nSource: WHO [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://covid19.who.int/table>\r\n\r\n\r\n*Daily case reports as of 3 Mar 2022 16:48 CET\r\n\r\nSurveillance\r\n------------\r\nWHO region (no. countries/territories):\r\nTotal confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWestern Pacific Region (19): 25 498 102 (585 009) / 184 142 (895)\r\nEuropean Region (61): 180 462 972 (749 262) / 1 879 356 (2971)\r\nSouth-East Asia Region (10): 55 941 245 (68 480) / 763 802 (431)\r\nEastern Mediterranean Region (22): 21 239 692 (19 050) / 334 767 (346)\r\nRegion of the Americas (54): 147 480 653 (130 815) / 2 637 306 (3389)\r\nAfrican Region (49): 8 344 835 (7340) / 170 053 (43)\r\nCases on an international conveyance: 764 (0) / 13 (0)\r\n\r\nConfirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\r\nGrand total: 438 968 263 (1 559 956) / 5 969 439 (8075)\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[Data by country, area, or territory for 3 Mar 2022 can be accessed at <https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WHO%20Data%20Tables%20MAR3_1646421060.pdf>.\r\n\r\n- The Americas region reported 8.3% of cases and 41.9% of deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported more than 147.48 million cases, 2nd to the European region as the most severely affected region.

The Minnesota patient survived, but the same disease recently killed a 5-year-old boy in Georgia and a 53-year-old woman in Kansas.\r\n\r\nThat's according to new details published Thursday [3 Mar 2021] in the New England Journal of Medicine, which outlined 4 cases of melioidosis in Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota and Texas that were linked to bottles of room sprays from Better Homes and Gardens. The bottles were labeled as a \"highly fragranced essential oil and semi-precious stone infused room spray\" with a \"lavender and chamomile\" scent. And now, the authors say healthcare professionals should more closely consider melioidosis in patients showing similar symptoms, even if they haven't traveled to places where the disease is endemic.\r\n\r\nAs Patch previously reported, Walmart recalled about 3900 bottles of \"Better Homes and Gardens Essential Oil Infused Aromatherapy Room Spray with Gemstones.\" The aromatherapy room spray was sold at 55 Walmart stores and online from February 2021 through October 2021 for about USD 4. One bottle of the essential oil sprays was found to contain _Burkholderia pseudomallei_, a dangerous bacterium that lives in soil and water and causes the melioidosis infection when ingested, breathed or absorbed through the skin. The infection, also called Whitmore's disease, can lead to skin abscesses in the absence of fever, pneumonia, sepsis, organ abscesses, genital infection, and inflamed brain or spinal cord.\r\n\r\nMost melioidosis cases are reported in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Northern Australia, as well as several other South Asia countries, though there have been cases reported in Puerto Rico, the British and US Virgin Islands, Central and South America, and parts of Africa and the Middle East, according to the CDC. But in America, cases are exceedingly rare. About a dozen are reported to the CDC each year, and the vast majority are linked to travel to areas where melioidosis is endemic. So experts were puzzled when 2 people in America died from the bacterium, and none of the 4 in the cluster of cases, which occurred over a period of just a few months, had traveled internationally.\r\n\r\nAfter testing numerous items the 4 patients were exposed to, researchers connected the strain of bacterium to an aromatherapy spray bottle that was imported from India.\r\n\r\nMinnesota case: In late May 2021, a 53-year-old man was rushed to a Minnesota emergency room after family members found him weak and in an altered mental state. The man had a history of medical issues, including a dependence on alcohol and tobacco. He, too, had not traveled internationally. An MRI of his brain showed his condition was consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy. The neurological disease is often characterized by confusion, an inability to coordinate voluntary movement and eye abnormalities. He was admitted to a hospital for treatment of acute metabolic encephalopathy. The man experienced hip pain while in the hospital, and additional MRI images showed some degeneration changes.\r\n\r\nAfter 6 days in the hospital, he was discharged to a transitional care facility. But on 6 Jun 2021, just 8 days after his initial emergency room visit, the man was moved back to the ER with a 104 deg F fever and deteriorating mental state. His oxygen saturation had fallen to 90%. He was given medication after chest scans showed evidence of pneumonia. Those meds were later switched to meropenem after he developed a new rash. The man's fever waned, and he was weaned off oxygen. The fever returned and the pain in his right hip worsened. An MRI showed acute inflammation, including myositis -- a rare disease characterized by inflamed muscles that can cause muscle fatigue and weakness -- a possibly septic hip and inflammation in his right pelvic bone.\r\n\r\nAs in other cases, he had positive blood cultures initially misidentified. The _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ was later identified on blood cultures and from a sample of his right hip joint. The patient was discharged to a transitional care facility on 23 Jun 2021. He completed 8 weeks of intravenous drugs and was given a schedule for eradication therapy. But even after discharge, he remained confused, researchers said, and showed evidence of osteonecrosis of the infected hip joint.\r\n\r\nMelioidosis was detected in all 4 patients, who each fell severely ill and who hadn't traveled to places where melioidosis was endemic. However, melioidosis might not have been initially considered because the 4 had not traveled to areas where the disease is endemic. Additionally, initial tests didn't uncover a _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ infection. Furthermore, the patients in Kansas, Texas and Georgia all received glucocorticoid therapy prior to being diagnosed with melioidosis, which could have contributed to the severity of disease, researchers said.\r\n\r\nThe Georgia boy's coronavirus infection also likely contributed to the severity of his illness. In a previous case, the CDC found that the coronavirus may have reactivated a previous fatal coinfection of COVID-19 and melioidosis in which the SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to have reactivated a latent _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ infection.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the 4 cases, the researchers highlighted the risks associated with exposure to imported products from areas where the bacterium is endemic. \"Healthcare providers should consider melioidosis in patients with a compatible illness, even if they do not have a history of travel to melioidosis-endemic areas,\" the study said. \"In addition, patients who have acute respiratory or neurologic symptoms that do not have a response to initial treatment may be candidates for closer assessment for melioidosis.\"\r\n\r\n[Byline: William Bornhoft]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[The citation for the New England Journal of Medicine report:\r\nGee JE, Bower WA, Kunkel A, et al. Multistate outbreak of melioidosis associated with imported aromatherapy spray. N Engl J Med 2022; 386: 861-8; <https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2116130>\r\n\r\nIn 2020, ProMED posted on a report of what was likely locally acquired melioidosis in Texas from 2018 (Cossaboom CM, Marinova-Petkova A, Strysko J, et al. Melioidosis in a resident of Texas with no recent travel history, United States. Emerg Infect Dis. 2020; 26(6): 1295-9; <https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2606.190975>). It is not clear where in Texas this more recent case was thought to be acquired.\r\n\r\nAlthough a classical infection in eastern Asia and northern Australia, cases have been acquired in Africa, the Caribbean basin, Central America, and South America, particularly Brazil and North America. This 2016 article (Limmathurotsakul D, Golding N, Dance DA, et al. Predicted global distribution of _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ and burden of melioidosis. Nat Microbiol. 2016; 1: 15008; <http://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol20158.pdf>) for 2015 estimates the burden of melioidosis for the areas of major and some risk as follows:\r\n\r\nArea / Population at risk in millions / Melioidosis cases in thousands / Melioidosis deaths in thousands\r\nSouth Asia / 1525 / 73 / 42\r\nEast Asia and Pacific / 858 / 65 / 31\r\nSub-Saharan Africa / 602 / 24 / 15\r\nLatin America and Caribbean / 246 / 2 / 1\r\nMiddle East and North Africa / 49 / <1 / <1\r\n\r\nMelioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition, such as diabetes (most common risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption (kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease).\r\n\r\nMelioidosis may present at any age but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, and chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.\r\n\r\nAcute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lungs can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, lung, liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80%-95%. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40%-50%. A small percentage of cases can occur as reactivations, even decades later, sometimes called the \"Vietnamese time bomb.\"\r\n\r\nAlong with a case acquired in the USA from tropical fish imported from South Asia (Melioidosis - USA (03): (MD) non-travel, 2019, freshwater aquarium source 20211001.8698818), 2021 was a surprising year for this disease in the USA. It is not clear what the mechanism of contamination of this product was and where along the manufacturing chain it occurred. Like with other uncommon infections, identification can be more difficult. - Mod.LL\n\nProMED map:\nUnited States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701797,106>]\n\n[See Also:\n2021\r\n----\r\nMelioidosis - UK: ex Ghana 20211118.8699755\r\nMelioidosis - Australia (02): (QL) roadwork related, 1998-2019 20211111.8699600\r\nMelioidosis - USA (08): non-travel, aromatherapy spray, CDC 20211104.8699454\r\nMelioidosis - USA (07): non-travel related, aromatherapy spray 20211027.8699303\r\nMelioidosis - USA (06): non-travel, aromatherapy spray, recall notice 20211023.8699210\r\nMelioidosis - USA (05): non-travel, aromatherapy spray, alert, recall 20211022.8699199\r\nMelioidosis - USA (04): (OH) ex BVI 20211015.8699075\r\nMelioidosis - USA (03): (MD) non-travel, 2019, fresh water aquarium source 20211001.8698818\r\nMelioidosis - USA (02): non-travel, possible common source 20210811.858507\r\nMelioidosis - USA: non-travel related, possible common source 20210701.8489365\r\nMelioidosis - Brazil: (CE) children, 1989-2019 20210622.8466777\r\nMelioidosis - Australia: (QL) 20210327.8271645\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nMelioidosis - Viet Nam: (QB) flooding, fatal 20201116.7947825\r\nMelioidosis - USA: (TX) 2018, poss local acquisition 20200527.7384438\r\nMelioidosis - Brazil: (PI) 20200215.6992576\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nMelioidosis - Viet Nam (02): (Hanoi) fatal, brothers 20191122.6792619\r\nMelioidosis - USA: (US Virgin Islands) post-hurricane, 2017 20190922.6685883\r\nMelioidosis - Viet Nam: fatal 20190912.6670538\r\nMelioidosis - Australia: (QL) 20190212.6313101\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nLeptospirosis, melioidosis - Australia: (QL) flooding, alert 20180310.5678104\r\nMelioidosis - Australia (02): (NT) 20180210.5620284\r\nMelioidosis - Australia: (NT) 20180202.5601113\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nMelioidosis - Australia (04): (NT) 20170412.4965903]\n.................................................mpp/ll/rd/mpp"

Although not fatal, these lesions can become infected and painful, and leave disfiguring scars.\r\n\r\n[ML's] diagnosis was traced back to a trip he made to Colombia's Magdalena Medio region, one of many remote, tropical locations where the sandflies that transmit the disease are present.\r\n\r\nThese types of rural locations are the backdrop to Diseased Landscapes [<https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/projects/humanities-social-sciences-tackling-global-challenges-diseased-landscapes/>], a project spearheaded by British and Colombian researchers exploring the impact of leishmaniasis on workers who pick coca -- the raw ingredient used to make cocaine. The research is focused near the Colombian-Venezuela border, one of the prime coca-growing areas of Colombia.\r\n\r\nCompared to other forms of informal employment, coca picking provides reliable income, paying approximately COP 80 000 (GBP 15) [about USD 21] per day. Not only is it attractive to people in this part of Colombia, where more than 56 per cent of the population's income is below the region's poverty line, but it's why low-income Venezuelan migrants come to areas like Catatumbo [Norte de Santander Department], says Alejandro Ca\u00f1izares, a research assistant for the Diseased Landscapes team.\r\n\r\nSince 2015, Venezuela's economic and political crisis has driven mass migration to Colombia, now home to nearly 2 million Venezuelan migrants. For 2 years the border between the 2 countries was closed but illegal armed groups help people cross clandestinely. Often, Venezuelan migrants who arrive via these irregular routes do not have documents or fixed incomes, leaving them vulnerable to the armed groups who \"lure them in\" to work on coca plantations, explains Elizabeth Dickinson, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group.\r\n\r\nThe manual work of raspachines or coca pickers is physically demanding. They toil under the sun for 30 to 45 days at a time, and are typically confined to coca farms and exposed to health risks like leishmaniasis, says Wilfredo Ca\u00f1izares, executive director of Fundaci\u00f3n Progresar, a human rights NGO working on the border. Coca pickers were unable to speak to The Telegraph due to security concerns.\r\n\r\nLeishmaniasis is endemic in Colombia; in 2020, the World Health Organisation reported 6124 cases of the cutaneous form of the disease, though scientists consider actual figures to be higher. It's one of the WHO's neglected tropical diseases, which according to Dr Iv\u00e1n V\u00e9lez, director of the University of Antioquia's Program for the Study and Control of Tropical Diseases (PECET), is why the country \"lacks good methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.\"\r\n\r\nIn Catatumbo, there are few hospitals and most are inaccessible. If patients make it to a clinic, many GPs lack the technical expertise to diagnose leishmaniasis, explains Dr Maria Adelaida G\u00f3mez, coordinator of the biochemistry and molecular biology unit at Colombia's International Centre for Training and Medical Research. This is one of the reasons case numbers are sorely underreported.\r\n\r\nOnly patients who receive a parasitological diagnosis are prescribed treatment. In Colombia, the most common treatment is glucantime -- highly toxic injections administered daily for between 20 and 28 days. Patients report experiencing headaches, nausea, and suffer a loss of appetite and fatigue.\r\n\r\n\"There were some days...when I was bed-bound with chills, my defences were low, I couldn't get up,\" [ML] says, remembering the treatment period. While he found the disease itself painless, the cure was tough: glucantime affected his ability to concentrate, and the tiredness left him unable to work.\r\n\r\nThese side effects can cause patients to abandon treatment, Dr V\u00e9lez says. Additionally, injections can only be administered by medical professionals, so patients must travel to hospitals to receive them.\r\n\r\nThe 1st choice treatment for leishmaniasis is a 28-day course of miltefosine tablets. However, tablets are not always available in Colombia and can cause side effects like vomiting and abdominal pain. Miltefosine is also not recommended for pregnant women.\r\n\r\nProblems accessing medical care and treatment in Colombia mean that leishmaniasis sufferers often resort to traditional cures or the guidance of local healers. Natural remedies are plant-based or involve burning lesions with a hot machete or hot panela (unrefined sugar). According to Dr V\u00e9lez, these can successfully treat cutaneous leishmaniasis but are painful.\r\n\r\nThe PECET is currently working to develop more treatments for cutaneous leishmaniasis. However, a lack of funding has prevented progress.\r\n\r\n\"The disease is associated with poverty,\" states Dr \u00c1lvaro Acosta-Serrano, a reader in the parasitology and vector biology departments at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.\r\n\r\nHistorically, sufferers of leishmaniasis have been stigmatised in Colombia because of the disease's association with Colombia's civil war, a time when case numbers were the highest ever. For low-income Venezuelans, whose migrant condition is already \"easily identifiable\" to Dr Acosta-Serrano, leishmaniasis scars can worsen discrimination.\r\n\r\nFor researchers, leishmaniasis is more than just a public health issue -- it's the lens that magnifies Colombia's working conditions that expose sufferers, including vulnerable migrants, to the disease. Not until [there is a reduction in] poverty, [improved] access to health care, and [stabilisation of] the ongoing conflict in rural areas, can leishmaniasis wounds really heal.\r\n\r\n\"Leishmaniasis [is] a way of seeing everything that is wrong with the system,\" says Juan Montoya, a Diseased Landscapes researcher.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Sophie Foggin, Grace Brennan]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[Leishmaniasis is endemic in Colombia, \"especially in sylvatic foci, and in the inter-Andean valleys, where working in coffee plantations can be seen as a risk factor. Epidemic outbreaks of CL [cutaneous leishmaniasis] caused by _L.eishmania braziliensis_, _L. guyanensis_, and _L. panamensis_.\"\r\n(<https://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/resources/COLOMBIA.pdf>)\r\n\r\nThe departments bordering Venezuela have previously been regarded as low incidence areas (Alvar J, V\u00e9lez ID, Bern C, et al; WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012; 7(5):e35671. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0035671.Suppl. S19 Colombia; <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035671>). The endemicity is due to abundance of animal reservoirs and of the sandfly vector. The report underlines that leishmaniasis is a disease of poverty and illegal immigrants from Venezuela are particularly at risk. - Mod.EP]\n\n[See Also:\n2017\r\n----\r\nLeishmaniasis - Colombia (02): (NS) visceral, alert: 20170602.5079868\r\nLeishmaniasis - Colombia: (HU) visceral, alert 20170502.5008792\r\n2016\r\n----\r\nLeishmaniasis, cutaneous - Colombia: (NS) alert: 20160429.4192208\r\nLeishmaniasis - Colombia: (TO) RFI: 20160403.4136205\r\n2015\r\n----\r\nLeishmaniasis - Colombia: (HU) canine 20150918.3653741\r\nTrypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) & leishmaniasis - Colombia 20150906.3628045\r\n2012\r\n----\r\nVisceral leishmaniasis - Colombia: (HU), alert 20120710.1195692\r\nLeishmaniasis, cutaneous - Colombia 20120616.1170287\r\n2011\r\n---\r\nLeishmaniasis, visceral - Colombia: blood transfusion 20110323.0914\r\nLeishmaniasis - Colombia: (ST) 20110227.0651\r\nand other items in the archives]\n.................................................sb/ep/mj/mpp"

The remainder of the state is under surveillance.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the Florida Department of Health as of this writing, No cases of this bird flu have been found in the domestic, backyard, or commercial birds in Florida.\r\n\r\nWild birds, particularly water birds, can carry many strains of low pathogenic avian influenza, most of which do not cause disease in domestic poultry.\r\n\r\nHowever, when a low pathogenic strain undergoes a mutation and forms a highly pathogenic strain, the mutated strain can cause significant disease in domestic poultry.\r\n\r\nThe HPAI virus is not easily transmissible from birds to humans, but health officials are concerned it could mutate into another form that could spread readily from person to person, triggering a pandemic.\r\n\r\nNo cases of human infections with HPAI have been reported in the United States as of this writing. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) considers the current risk to the public to below.\r\n\r\nAs risk depends on exposure, it is best to not touch sick or dead wild birds. If such instances are necessary, persons handling such wild birds should use personal protective equipment such as protective clothing, rubber boots, gloves, eye protection, and face shields.\r\n\r\nAfter handling the bird, these items can be disinfected with a 10% bleach water solution.\r\n\r\nTo keep domestic, backyard, and commercial flocks free of this virus, it is recommended that all poultry (chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, etc.) be housed inside a coop with a solid roof and that steps be taken to prevent wild birds from entering the coop.\r\n\r\nIt is also recommended to limit visits to your coop to only those who regularly handle your poultry. Report sick or dead birds to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) or your veterinarian.\r\n\r\nTo help in the tracking of HPAI:\r\n- Report sick or dead commercial or backyard birds to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS.gov) or your veterinarian,\r\n- Report wild bird mortalities to <http://app.myfwc.com/FWRI/AvianMortality/>\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[ProMED map of Florida, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701793,212>]\r\n\r\n[The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 on the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. The current propagation of H5N1 in the Americas seems to be associated with the Atlantic Americas flyway.\r\n\r\nIt is important to take into account that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that they are poor spreaders and instead may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. - Mod.PMB]\n\n[See Also:\nAvian influenza (59): Americas (USA) mixed poultry, wild, captive bird 20220303.8701765\r\nAvian influenza (57): Americas (USA) mixed poultry, captive bird, HPAI H5N1 20220302.8701740\r\nAvian influenza (53): Americas (USA) wild bird, poultry, HPAI H5N1 20220225.8701648\r\nAvian influenza (50): Americas (Canada, USA) poultry, mixed flock, wild bird, HPAI 20220221.8701557\r\nAvian influenza (45): Americas (USA) poultry, mixed flock, HPAI H5N1 20220215.8701469\r\nAvian influenza (43): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220214.8701447\r\nAvian influenza (41): Americas (USA) poultry, HPAI H5N1, OIE 20220211.8701404\r\nAvian influenza (40): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220210.8701387\r\nAvian influenza (39): Americas (USA) turkey, HPAI H5N1 20220209.8701372\r\nAvian influenza (36): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220208.8701339\r\nAvian influenza (32): Americas (Canada) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220202.8701217\r\nAvian influenza (30): Americas (USA) wild bird 20220201.8701178\r\nAvian influenza (22): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 Archive Number: 20220120.8700990\r\nAvian influenza (19): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5, OIE 20220117.8700932\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (39): USA (SC) poultry, HPAI H7N3 20200410.7206731\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (79): USA (TN): poultry, HPAI H7N9 20170317.4908223\r\nAvian influenza (78): USA poultry, (AL) H7, (TN) H7N9, both LPAI 20170317.4906690\r\nAvian influenza (71): USA (WI) turkey, HPAI H7N9 20170311.4893871\r\nAvian influenza (69): USA (TN) poultry, HPAI H7N9 20170309.4888517\r\nAvian influenza (67): USA (TN) poultry, HPAI H7, OIE 20170307.4883078\r\nAvian influenza (66): USA (TN) poultry, HPAI, H7 20170305.4881365\r\n2016\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (15): USA (IN) poultry, HPAI & LPAI H7N8 20160121.3953508\r\nAvian influenza (11): USA (IN) poultry, HPAI/LPAI H7N8 20160120.3950429\r\nAvian influenza (08): USA (IN) poultry, HPAI revised to LPAI H7N8, update 20160118.3944747\r\n2015\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (164): USA (GA) HPAI H5N2, poultry, proactive prevention 20150620.3452030\r\nAvian influenza (151): USA (MN,IA) HPAI H5N2, poultry 20150606.3414670\r\nAvian influenza (141): USA: (MN) HPAI H5N2, poultry 20150531.3397688\r\nAvian influenza (120): USA, HPAI H5N2, poultry, turkey 20150510.3352747\r\nAvian influenza (87): USA, HPAI H5N2, turkey, poultry 20150418.3305689\r\nAvian influenza (80): USA, HPAI H5N2, turkey, poultry 20150415.3298419\r\nAvian influenza (74): USA (MN,ND) HPAI H5N2, turkey 20150412.3292191\r\nAvian influenza (59): USA (MN): turkey, H5N2 20150329.3264089]\n.................................................sb/pmb/mj/mpp"

However, militants often target polio teams and police assigned to protect them in Pakistan, falsely claiming the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Wednesday's attack [2 Mar 2022] happened on the outskirts of the city of Peshawar. Iqra Iqbal was gunned down on her way home, said Iftikhar Khan, a police official.\r\n\r\nPakistan regularly launches anti-polio campaigns in an effort to eradicate the highly infectious disease. The latest 5-day drive against polio started on Monday [28 Feb 2022].\r\n\r\nSince January last year [2021], Pakistan has not reported any new cases, raising hopes the Islamic nation is close to becoming a polio-free country. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only remaining countries in the world still trying to eradicate polio, which can cause severe paralysis in children.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\r\n\r\n[Repeating what I said in response to the violence in Afghanistan last week, \"What can one say above and beyond what we've said previously. It's hard to fathom why healthcare workers are being targeted. As long as this type of violence continues, the probability of polio eradication remains seriously challenged.\"\r\n\r\nFor a map of Pakistan showing provinces and districts, see <https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/pak215_pakistan_districts_v5_a0_20181203.pdf>. - Mod.MPP]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] Africa outbreaks\r\nDate: Thu 3 Mar 2022\r\nSource: Science [edited]\r\n<https://www.science.org/content/article/africa-battles-out-of-control-polio-outbreaks>\r\n\r\n\r\nOn [17 Feb 2022], Malawi's Ministry of Health announced a nasty surprise: A 3-year-old girl who was paralyzed in November 2021 was infected with the wild poliovirus, which Africa officially vanquished in 2020. The sequence of the virus showed it had somehow made the leap from Pakistan, one of the last 2 holdouts of the wild virus. A week later came bad news from Afghanistan: Gunmen killed 8 polio workers in the country's northeast.\r\n\r\nThe incidents are the latest setbacks on the long, bumpy road to global polio eradication. Yet Pakistan has \"exported\" wild poliovirus before, sparking outbreaks that were quickly snuffed out, and the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan improved dramatically last year [2021], with polio cases tumbling to a historic low.\r\n\r\nInstead, perhaps the biggest threat to the effort now is an explosion of vaccine-derived polio outbreaks in Africa that affected almost 2 dozen countries last year [2021] and paralyzed more than 500 children in 2020 and again in 2021. Vaccine-derived strains emerge where children are un- or underimmunized, allowing the live, weakened virus in the oral polio vaccine (OPV) to circulate and accumulate enough mutations to revert to its neurovirulent form and paralyze kids. These outbreaks -- which almost always emerge from type 2 poliovirus, one of the 3 virus strains -- are \"very worrying\" and \"front burner\" at the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), says John Vertefeuille of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a partner in the initiative.\r\n\r\nA big part of the problem is that countries don't view vaccine-derived strains as an emergency, says Simona Zipursky, an adviser to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) polio program, even though they behave just like the wild virus. \"It is not like there is a milder variant as there is with COVID-19,\" Zipursky says. Nigeria's widely lauded victory over the wild virus -- it was the last African country to achieve that feat -- fed a sense that \"the job was done,\" says WHO's Aidan O'Leary, who directs GPEI. The quality of Nigeria's polio program, once among the best in the world, slipped, and today the country is \"the most important generator\" of vaccine-derived polioviruses, says Jay Wenger of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, another partner in GPEI. Nigeria accounted for more than half of all vaccine-derived polio cases globally last year [2021] and exported the virus to 18 countries.\r\n\r\nOther factors have contributed, too. Lately, many African countries have been slow to respond to new outbreaks as they wait for a new vaccine that they think will solve the problems, which has allowed the virus to spread. Many are frustrated with the existing vaccine, monovalent OPV2 (mOPV2); they would use it to quash an outbreak but then, because the vaccine virus occasionally reverts, the response would seed more outbreaks.\r\n\r\nKnown as novel OPV2 (nOPV2), the new vaccine was engineered to be as effective as mOPV2 but more genetically stable, greatly lessening the chance it will revert. The vaccine, funded by the Gates foundation, was rolled out in a few countries in March 2021 under an emergency use authorization.\r\n\r\nPending its arrival, Senegal waited for almost 1 year before responding to a virus detected in late 2020, instead of using readily available supplies of mOPV2. \"If the virus gets a head start for such a long time it is harder to stop,\" says Mark Pallansch, who recently retired from CDC but remains involved in GPEI.\r\n\r\nAlthough early data suggest nOPV2 is indeed less likely to trigger outbreaks, Pallansch thinks its promise has been oversold. \"Governments thought, if I can just get it, things will be fine,\" he says. But countries ran nOPV2 campaigns of poor quality, reaching just a fraction of the target population. Nigeria has burned through about 184 million nOPV2 doses, out of 255 million used so far, and still hasn't stopped many of its outbreaks. The new vaccine \"is not a magic bullet,\" Zipursky says.\r\n\r\nA new threat\r\n------------\r\nPakistan and Afghanistan are the last 2 countries where the wild poliovirus is endemic. Cases in both dropped sharply last year (left). Vaccine-derived outbreaks are now a big threat to polio eradication -- especially in Africa (right). [This text discusses graphs available at the source URL. - Mod.MPP]\r\n\r\nGPEI and other international bodies are hammering home that countries should respond to any outbreak immediately with whatever type 2 vaccine is available. The mantra is \"faster, better, bigger,\" O'Leary says: Be quicker to detect and respond to outbreaks, improve the vaccination campaigns, and broaden them. \"We need to conduct them not where you think the virus is, but, based on migration patterns, where you think it will be,\" he says.\r\n\r\nThe new worries come as Pakistan and Afghanistan, the last 2 endemic countries, are doing surprisingly well, with just 5 reported cases of wild poliovirus last year [2021], down from 140 in 2020. Pakistan has just gone an entire year without a case. (Vaccine-derived cases in both countries are way down as well.) \"It looks better than it ever has,\" Wenger says. The low numbers are \"absolutely not\" an artifact, says Hamid Jafari, who heads the eradication program in the region; surveillance remains \"really, really good.\" Some of the gains stem from very favorable epidemiology. Polio resurged in both countries in 2019 and 2020, and \"after a peak we always see a trough,\" Jafari says, in part because of increased population immunity. Reduced travel during the COVID-19 pandemic helped.\r\n\r\nIn Pakistan, vaccination drives already cover most of the target population, and they are improving, Jafari says. Imran Khan, Pakistan's prime minister, is actively involved. Bill Gates just visited the country to bolster enthusiasm. In Afghanistan, too, \"we've made more progress than we could have anticipated,\" O'Leary says. After resuming power in August 2021, the Taliban rescinded its ban on house-to-house polio vaccination in its strongholds, which had left 3.5 million children out of reach. (In some areas GPEI is still restricted to vaccinating in mosques.) Vaccination campaigns in November [2021], December [2021], and January [2022] reached 8.5 million out of 9.9 million children, Jafari says, including 2.6 million who were inaccessible for 3.5 years.\r\n\r\nBut future campaigns could be hobbled if last week's killings are a harbinger of further violence. And Jafari suspects the virus may survive in small populations that move back and forth across the border between the 2 countries. A couple of positive environmental samples detected in December [2021] in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan show the virus is still lurking there. Jafari worries it could resurge when the weather warms and people begin to travel for Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr. The recent spread to Malawi underscores the risk of further delays, he says: \"We want to kill the virus now.\"\r\n\r\n[Byline: Leslie Roberts]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[The article in item 3 above is an excellent summary of the challenges faced by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). While last week it was an attack in Afghanistan, this week it's an attack in Pakistan (see item 2 above). What shouldn't be neglected is the comment \"\"after a peak we always see a trough\"\" referring to the decrease in cases seen in 2021 following a very active transmission year in 2020. As a reminder, following a major epidemic it takes time to build up a susceptible population that will serve as a pool for continued circulation of the poliovirus; both the wild poliovirus (WPV) as well as the circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). Interpretation of success should be cautious... especially following the case in Malawi where the implicated virus circulated undetected for 2 years. A similar event happened in Borno, Nigeria in 2016 (see Poliomyelitis update (13): Nigeria (BO) 20160905.4467318, Poliomyelitis update (11): Nigeria (BO) 20160811.4410331, and Poliomyelitis update (10): Nigeria (BO), new cases, RFI 20160811.4408853).\r\n\r\nAnother cause for concern is the heavy focus on eradication of the WPV and a seemingly lesser concern about cVDPVs. Is polio eradication only for the wild poliovirus or is it for all polioviruses that can be transmitted? The cVDPVs are derived from vaccine viruses that have reverted to a more wild virus-like neurovirulence. Will we eradicate WPV but continue to fight cVDPVs? - Mod.MPP]\n\n[See Also:\nPoliomyelitis update (06): global AFP, WPV1, cVDPV1 & cVDPV2, RFI 20220226.8701660\r\nPoliomyelitis update (05): Guinea-Bissau, cVDPV, RFI 20220218.8701539\r\nPoliomyelitis update (04): cVDPV2 (Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia), WPV1 Malawi 20220218.8701529\r\nPoliomyelitis update (03): WPV1 (AFP Afghanistan), cVDPV2 (AFP; ES Djibouti) 20220212.8701429\r\nPoliomyelitis update (02): global cVDPV1 (ES Madagascar), cVDPV2 (multicountry), 2021 20220129.8701140\r\nPoliomyelitis update (01): WPV1 (ES), cVDPV1+2 (AFP) 2021, COVID 20220103.8700644\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nPoliomyelitis update (25): global cVDPV2 (multicountry) Pakistan violence 20211218.8700356\r\nPoliomyelitis update (24): Yemen, WHO, comment 20211211.8700196\r\nPoliomyelitis update (23): global (WPV1 Afghanistan, cVDPV2 Cameroon, Nigeria) 20211210.8700170\r\nPoliomyelitis update (22): global (WPV1 Afghanistan, cVDPV2 multicountry), IHR 20211129.8699938\r\nPoliomyelitis update (21): global (WPV1 Pakistan ES, cVDPV2 multicountry) 20210904.8644347\r\nPoliomyelitis update (20): global (WPV1, cVDPV2, cVDPV1), Gambia, Uganda 20210821.8612882\r\nPoliomyelitis update (19): global (cVDPV2) Gambia, Pakistan, RFI 20210813.8591368\r\nPoliomyelitis update (18): global (WPV1,cVDPV1,cVDPV2), Pakistan violence 20210808.8577968\r\nPoliomyelitis update (17): global(cVDPV1,cVDPV2 Uganda/Gambia) Pakistan, Nigeria 20210730.8557717\r\nPoliomyelitis update (16): global (cVDPV1, cVDPV2), Nigeria 20210722.8538466\r\nPoliomyelitis update (15): global (cVDPV2), Nigeria 20210715.8522150\r\nPoliomyelitis update (14): Global (WPV1 ES, cVDPV2, cVDPV1) 20210708.8505008\r\nPoliomyelitis update (13): global (cVDPV2 Nigeria, Egypt environmental sample) 20210702.8489890\r\nPoliomyelitis update (12): global (cVDPV2, WPV1 ES) 20210624.8473119\r\nPoliomyelitis update (11): global (cVDPV2), vaccinator violence 20210618.8456569\r\nPoliomyelitis update (10): Senegal, cVDPV2 20210614.8447598\r\nPoliomyelitis update (09): global (WPV1 ES, cVDPV2 AFP cases) RFI 20210611.8442001\r\nPoliomyelitis update (08): global (cVDPV2), Afghanistan 20210603.8421558\r\nPoliomyelitis update (07): global, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Somalia, WHO 20210527.8382587\r\nPoliomyelitis update (06): global, Africa 20210516.8363867\r\nPoliomyelitis update (05): global, Afghanistan campaign, Yemen 20210419.8313248\r\nPoliomyelitis update (04): global, WPV1, cVDPV 20210312.8242333\r\nPoliomyelitis update (03): global, WPV1, cVDPV 20210309.8236114\r\nPoliomyelitis update (02): global, WPV1, cDPV 20210222.8205197\r\nPoliomyelitis update (01): Pakistan, global (Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone) RFI 20210102.8064119\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nPoliomyelitis update (24): global (WPV1; cVDPV2) 20201229.8053858\r\nCOVID-19 update (77): global, polio vacc on hold, new countries, WHO 20200404.7182744\r\nPoliomyelitis update (01): global (WPV1, cVDPV2), Pakistan (KP, SD) 20200103.6869841\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nPoliomyelitis update (106): Pakistan (KP) RFI 20191231.6865382\r\nPoliomyelitis update (01): global 20190104.6241814\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nPoliomyelitis update (62): (Nigeria, Niger) cVDPV2 20181228.6226490\r\nPoliomyelitis update (01): global (Afghanistan) 20180105.5539242\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nPoliomyelitis update (47): Pakistan, global (Congo DR) 20171229.5526565\r\nPoliomyelitis (01): Pakistan (GB), global, RFI 20170314.4898724\r\nand other items in the archives]\n.................................................sb/mpp/may/mpp"

It cannot be caught through eating pork or pig products. The disease is not transmitted from person to person.\r\n\r\n\"This is the first time the virus has been detected in southern Australia, and biosecurity authorities are working with their human health departments to understand the implications and risks of human exposure.\r\n\r\n\"The Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment are collaborating closely, together with state and territory counterparts.\r\n\r\n\"We are meeting regularly and working together to work through the next steps of this situation.\r\n\r\n\"We're asking anyone who works with pigs or horses, even if they're a pet in the backyard, to keep an eye out for and report any possible signs of this disease.\r\n\r\n\"The most common symptoms in pigs are mummified or stillborn piglets, or piglets who show neurological problems in the first 6 months of life. The disease tends to be asymptomatic in adult sows, but boars can experience infertility and testicle congestion.\r\n\r\n\"Horses can experience a range of symptoms. While most infected horses do not show signs of disease, some more severe signs of JEV in horses include fever, jaundice, lethargy, anorexia and neurological signs which can vary in severity.\r\n\r\n\"JEV is a nationally notifiable disease, which means if you suspect an animal is showing signs of the disease, you must report it (see contact details below). Measures should also be taken to protect animals from mosquitoes -- for instance, applying a safe insect repellent and putting a summer rug on horses.\"\r\n\r\nActing Chief Medical Officer Dr Sonya Bennett said JEV infections can be contracted by humans through the bite of a mosquito. There are no confirmed human cases in Australia at this stage, although this is under active investigation. \"We are aware that several cases of encephalitis of unknown cause have been identified in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia within the past month.\r\n\r\n\"JE is also a notifiable disease in humans and health authorities across the country are on the alert for human cases and are in direct contact with people associated with the affected piggeries,\" Dr Bennett said.\r\n\r\n\"Pigs are the focus from a human health perspective as they can infect mosquitoes who then infect humans. This is not the case with horses.\r\n\r\n\"Severe illness arising from JEV infection in humans is rare and most people will have no symptoms at all if infected.\r\n\r\n\"However, a very small proportion of people infected may develop a serious illness such as encephalitis and experience symptoms including neck stiffness, severe headache and coma, and more rarely, permanent neurological complications or death.\r\n\r\n\"Encephalitis is the most serious clinical consequence of JEV infection. Illness usually begins with symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, headache and vomiting.\r\n\r\n\"Anyone experiencing these symptoms, particularly if they've visited regions in eastern Australia or South Australia where there has been high mosquito activity, should seek urgent medical attention.\r\n\r\n\"Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of infection caused by JEV in patients in affected areas with encephalitis and refer people for appropriate testing, after other common causes have been excluded.\r\n\r\n\"There is work underway to plan for targeted vaccinations. Two different vaccines are available for protection against JEV in Australia and are very safe and effective for both adults and children.\r\n\r\n\"However, prevention is always better than a cure and there are simple steps we can all take to avoid our exposure to infected mosquitos\r\n\r\n\"People in areas of high mosquito activity in Eastern Australia should use mosquito repellent containing picaridin or DEET on all exposed skin.\r\n\r\n\"Wear long, loose fitting clothing when outside, and ensure accommodation, including tents, are properly fitted with mosquito nettings or screens.\r\n\r\n\"We will continue to meet with health authorities in the states and territories to progress the public health response to this disease.\"\r\n\r\nTo report suspected JEV in pigs or other animals, contact your local veterinarian or call the national Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[The immediate notification report complements the information already published in ProMED postings 20220301.8701721 and 20220228.8701705.\r\n\r\n\"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae and causes encephalitis, principally in horses and humans. JEV also infects pigs where it causes abortions and stillbirths. JEV is maintained in nature between mosquitoes, pigs and water birds. The major vector of JEV throughout most of Asia is _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, however other species may be locally important. Pigs act as important amplifiers of the virus, and birds can also be involved in its amplification and spread in the environment. The disease has been observed in large parts of Asia and recently in the western Pacific region. In horses, the infection is usually inapparent. Affected horses show clinical signs that include pyrexia, depression, muscle tremors, and ataxia. In pigs, abortions and stillbirths can occur when pregnant sows are infected with JEV for the first time. Infected pregnant sows usually show no clinical signs\".

Two further cases were detected in humans in Queensland in 1998, including one acquired on the Australian mainland. Most recently, a human case was detected on the Tiwi Islands in 2021\".

And recently, more dogs have tested positive at the shelter.\r\n\r\n\"Over the last few weeks, it started to ramp up and so our positivity rate now is around 17% to 18%. It doesn't get critical until it's over 30%,\" Steele said.\r\n\r\nSo now, ACC has stopped all nose-to-nose contact, quarantining the dogs, except for several walks a day.\r\n\r\nIndividual leashes are now clipped to each kennel, and more wash stations have been installed to help with deep cleaning.\r\n\r\nA play yard is usually filled with about 5 to 6 dogs, a place where they can stretch their legs, get exercise, and be a dog. But now to help stop the spread of the virus only one dog is allowed in here at a time.\"\r\n\r\n\"From the time there might have been an exposure to the time you're going to see clinical signs is going be less than 7 days,\" Chapman said.\r\n\r\nACC is looking for more foster families, increasing adoptions, and asking its rescue partners to help take the healthy adoptable dogs out of the building so they don't get infected.\r\n\r\nBut they should quarantine for at least 2 weeks as a precaution.OOOOoOOOO\r\n\r\n[Byline: Ryan Hughes]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n\n[We are saddened the shelter is experiencing such a challenging situation.\r\n\r\nThis article does not provide details on how the shelter knew it was Pneumovirus or what steps they went through getting it diagnosed. Outbreaks of acute respiratory disease in dogs often involve multiple pathogens.\r\n\r\nPneumoviruses also include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) often associated with diseases in human being and murine pneumovirus (MPV), traditionally known as pneumonia virus of mice. While there are other Pneumoviruses, the one affecting dogs is most closely related to the mouse or MPV version and a small number of human RSV. This virus was first isolated/studied in around 2010 in dogs. \r\n\r\nWhile the virus has been isolated and identified, and may be more common than we know, it is not often diagnosed, probably because it is from an individual animal or treated symptomatically. However, it really becomes noticeable when large numbers are affected, such as a shelter. \r\n\r\nCanine pneumovirus contributes to what is commonly referred to as the canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRD). Clinical signs of canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC) may include sneezing, nasal and ocular discharge, and sometimes lower respiratory and/or systemic disease.\r\n\r\nViral pathogens associated with CIRDC in dogs include:\r\n\u2022\tParainfluenza\r\n\u2022\tAdenovirus-2\r\n\u2022\tRespiratory coronavirus (this is distinct from canine enteric coronavirus)\r\n\u2022\tHerpesvirus-1\r\n\u2022\tPneumovirus \r\n\u2022\tAnd other respiratory syncytial viruses. [Mentioned above.]\r\n\r\nBacterial pathogens implicated in CIRDC include:\r\n\u2022\t_Bordetella bronchiseptica_\r\n\u2022\t_Mycoplasma_ spp.\r\n\u2022\t_Streptococcus zooepidemicus_ (may cause severe systemic disease)\r\n\r\nIf your pet is having difficulty breathing, listless, depressed, and may not be eating/drinking well, it is advisable to have your pet seen by a veterinarian as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nEarly treatment can help, as can prevention methods of vaccines to help protect your pet. While there is not currently a vaccine for this virus, there are some vaccines associated with respiratory diseases which may reduce and/or prevent the clinical signs of this disease.\r\n\r\nPortions of this comment were extracted from Pneumovirus in Dogs with Acute Respiratory Disease published in Emerging Infectious Diseases (www.cdc.gov/eid, Vol. 16, No. 6, June 2010) and from <https://www.uwsheltermedicine.com/library/resources/canine-infectious-respiratory-disease-complex-a-k-a-kennel-cough>. - Mod.TG]\r\n\r\n[A good review article on the canine pneumovirus can be found at: Mitchell JA, Cardwell JM, Renshaw RW, Dubovi EJ, Brownlie J.

The sublineage of the current strain was reported from Jordan and Israel (local laboratories) as ANT.\r\n\r\nIn Kefar Yehoshua, at least 5 cattle farms (beef fattening and dairy operations), and one sheep farm have been reported as infected. In Nahalal 2 cattle farms have so far been reported as infected. \r\n\r\nAccording to media reports, Jordan (likely assisted by FAO's technical project TCP/JOR/3808), the P.A. and Syria (in particular, Suwaida province, bordering Jordan), have undertaken mass FMD vaccinations. Hopefully, samples have been submitted from the 3 territories to a reference laboratory, for confirmatory genotyping and vaccine matching tests; these results are urgently needed. - Mod.AS\n\nProMED map:\nIsrael: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701784,90>]\n\n[See Also:\nFoot & mouth disease - Jordan (02): (IR,BA) cattle, st O, spread   20220213.8701433\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel: (HM,HZ) cattle, st O, OIE 20220209.8701353\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Jordan: cattle, goat, sheep, st O, spread 20220127.8701102\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Palestinian Auth: (WE) spread, st O, vacc 20220123.8701032\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Palestinian Auth (03): (WE) sheep, goat, st O, genotyped, OIE 20211231.8700601\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Jordan (03): cattle, goat, sheep, st O, genotyped, spread 20211229.8700556\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Jordan (02): (AM) cattle, serotype not typed, OIE 20211111.8699579\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Palestinian Auth (02): (GZ) cattle, st O, OIE, RFI 20211224.8700454\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Palestinian Auth: (WE) sheep, goat, st pending, OIE 20211216.8700299\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Jordan: (AM) cattle, susp 20211105.8699471\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel (04): (HZ) cattle, spread 20210611.8441061\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel (03): (HZ) cattle, spread 20210312.8243802\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel (02): (HZ) deer, gt O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2, spread 20210127.8141870\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel: (HZ) cattle, goat, st O, OIE 20210107.8079606\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Syria: (LA) goat, spread, RFI 20210422.8320257\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Syria: (HA) livestock, spread, Iraq susp, RFI 20210216.8194894\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Lebanon: (NA) cattle, spread, RFI 20210219.8201498\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Palestinian Auth (02): (WE) sheep, goats, st pending, OIE 20190403.6400967\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Palestinian Auth: (WE) sheep, 2018, st O, tt EA-3 20190216.6320472\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel (04): (HA) cattle, st O, spread, OIE 20190807.6610873\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel (03): (HA) cattle, gt Foot) 20190524.6486015\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel (02): (HA) cattle, st. pending, OIE, RFI 20190510.6462227\r\nFoot & mouth disease - Israel: (HZ) cattle, st.

Most of the common active ingredients used in synthetic marijuana are illegal to buy, sell or possess in the United States, per the Poison Control website.\r\n \r\nIn Hillsborough County, Florida, cases of severe bleeding linked to spice use began cropping up in early December [2021], according to a [6 Dec 2021] Facebook post shared by Florida's Poison Information Centers.

Consequently, severe bleeding can occur and without prompt treatment can result in death. \r\n\r\nWe are not told in this article which rodenticide was involved, but from a case in Illinois we know some of the rodenticides. \r\n\r\nExtracted from ProMED post Drug abuse - USA (03): (IL) synthetic cannabinoids, bleeding disorder 20180411.5740877:\r\nThe rodenticide identified in Illinois is brodifacoum, a long acting vitamin K (clotting factor) antagonist anticoagulant, which is lethal. It is a coumarinderivative, specifically a 4-hydroxycoumarin. It is a very widely used anticoagulant rodenticide. The good news is brodifacoum can be treated with vitamin K and blood transfusions if caught early enough. However, there are rodenticides on the market today for which there is no treatment.\r\n\r\nBrodifacoum is lethal, and if you have any signs of bleeding or bruising, please have someone take you to a hospital.

Just months later, he suffered devastating complications and died, aged 26.\r\n\r\nHis widow, said: 'It's difficult to find the words to describe the last few months and trying to come to terms with what happened. 'What's even more worrying is that a number of patients at the hospital around the same time were diagnosed with infections, with serious consequences.'\r\n\r\n[The patient] was found to have the rare bug _Mycobacterium chelonae_ [now called _Mycobacteroides chelonae_- Mod.JH], which attacks bone and skin tissue, 6 months after his June 2019 operation. The same bug had been discovered in the hospital's water supply.\r\n\r\nIn August 2019, the deadly bug _Mycobacterium abscessus_ [now called _Mycobacteroides abscessus_- Mod.JH] was also found in the supply after the hospital moved to a new GBP 200 million [about USD 263.7 million] site in Cambridge. A total of 21 patients were infected, 5 of whom had received transplants.\r\n\r\nLast month [February 2022], we revealed a coroner had launched an investigation into the 2020 deaths of [a patient], 54, and [another patient], 60, who had been infected with it.\r\n\r\nInquests into all 3 deaths are due to be held later this year [2022]. The families are represented by law firm Irwin Mitchell, who said: 'They have all been devastated by what happened.'\r\n\r\nRoyal Papworth contests that [the 26-year-old's] death is linked to the same outbreak, saying: 'There has never been a recorded outbreak of _M. chelonae_ at our Trust.'\r\n\r\n[Byline: Michael Powell]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[_Mycobacteroides (formerly _Mycobacterium_) abscessus_ and _Mycobacteroides (formerly _Mycobacterium_) chelonae_ are both acid-fast bacilli that are part of a grouping separate from _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex, known as non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) (<http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/mycobacterium.html>). NTMs are environmental mycobacteria, found in natural and potable freshwater and soil. NTM can form biofilms on the inner surfaces of water distribution systems, which are resistant to chlorine (<https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00190/full>), constituting a risk for certain people by microaspiration or by inhalation of aerosols. Water from these systems can also contaminate medications and medical instruments.\r\n\r\nNTM differ among themselves based on in vitro growth rate and colonial pigmentation:\r\n- Rapidly growing, non-pigmented mycobacteria (RGM) produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation and include the _Mycolicibacterium (formerly _Mycobacterium_) fortuitum_ complex and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group (<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33304323/>). The _M. abscessus_ subset includes _M. abscessus_ sensu stricto, _M. massiliense_ and _M. bolletii_.\r\n- Slowly growing NTM, which require more than 7 days to produce mature growth on agar plates, include _Mycobacterium marinum_, _M. gordonae_. _M. kansasii_, and the _M. avium/intracellulare_ complex. Other slow growers include _M. ulcerans_, _M. haemophilum_, and _M. simiae_.\r\n\r\n_M. abscessus_ is a multidrug-resistant organism. It is resistant to most beta-lactams, likely due to its bacterial cell wall biochemistry and to a broad-spectrum, chromosomally encoded Ambler class A beta-lactamase (BlaMab) (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6167491/>). Of the beta-lactam subclasses, carbapenems have the greatest activity against _M. abscessus_, and among the carbapenems, imipenem the most activity against _M. abscessus_ (<https://jcm.asm.org/content/54/6/1586>).\r\n\r\nImipenem is currently recommended as part of 1st-line treatments for _M. abscessus_ infections. Meropenem, another carbapenem, is less active than is imipenem when used alone against _M. abscessus_. BlaMab is resistant to inhibition by the beta-lactamase inhibitors clavulanate, tazobactam and sulbactam (<https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/69/3/691/784297>). However, 2 newer non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitors -- relebactam (marketed with imipenem) and vaborbactam (marketed with meropenem) -- improve the activity of both these carbapenems against _M. abscessus_ (<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57844-8> and <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6395916/>). Combinations of different beta-lactam subclasses, such as amoxicillin plus imipenem/relebactam, may be required to fully inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis in _M. abscessus_ (<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57844-8>).\r\n\r\nThe erm(41) gene, which confers inducible macrolide resistance through methylation of ribosomal RNA, is present in the _M. abscessus_ complex group, but many strains of _M. massiliense_ have a nonfunctional erm(41) gene, and because of this, the rate of macrolide susceptibility is higher in _M. massiliense_ than in the other _M. abscessus_ complex organisms (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4550155/>). Efflux pumps have also been shown to contribute to macrolide resistance in _M. abscessus_ (<https://www.dovepress.com/efflux-pumps-contribute-to-intrinsic-clarithromycin-resistance-in-clin-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IDR>).\r\n\r\n_M. chelonae_ most commonly causes infection of the skin and skin structures, such as surgical site and implantable device infections. _M. chelonae_ is not macrolide-resistant and does not have an erythromycin methylase (erm) gene so macrolides are effective for treating _M. chelonae_ infections, whereas they are generally not effective for _M. abscessus_ infections because most isolates have an active erm gene (<https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201501-015OI>).\r\n\r\nUnlike _M. chelonae_, _M. abscessus_ is a pulmonary pathogen. Infection with _M. abscessus_ is usually treated with a combination therapy of amikacin, tigecycline, cefoxitin, and imipenem, combined with oral clarithromycin or azithromycin, if the patient's isolate is macrolide susceptible, for one month, followed by a combination of clofazimine, linezolid, minocycline, moxifloxacin, or co-trimoxazole for 12 months, depending on results of susceptibility testing.

Taking into account the severe course of the disease, in order to avoid further complications, the RA Ministry of Health urges the following:\r\n\r\n- Avoid homemade canned food.\r\n- Heat homemade canned food by boiling it for 20-25 minutes before using it.\r\n- Do not buy homemade canned food from the market or random individuals.\r\n- See a doctor immediately as soon as the 1st symptoms appear.\r\n\r\nThe main symptoms of botulism are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, shortness of breath, obstruction of the act of aspiration, and unilateral paralysis. These symptoms appear 2-3 hours to 10 days after eating the affected food.\r\n\r\nBotulism is a severe food poisoning caused by [toxins produced by the bacterium] _Clostridium botulinum_. The pathogen is found in the external environment, as spores, from where it spreads to vegetables and greens. Low oxygen, low acid conditions are required for the growth and development of this pathogen, where it reproduces and produces toxin. Such conditions are created in hermetically sealed cans. Destruction of the pathogen is possible only in special devices, under the influence of high pressure (1.5-2 atmospheres), and adequate heat (120-130 deg C / 248-266 deg F) in autoclaves, which are available only in canning companies. These conditions may not be easily met at home.\r\n\r\nFood affected by botulism does not change its taste, smell, color, or appearance.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Haris Hays]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[It is not clear if any of these cases diagnosed in 2022 were related to the home-canned cucumbers that were reported in late 2021 in Armenia.\r\n\r\nThe neurological symptoms of botulism with cranial nerve findings and flaccid paralysis, which can culminate in respiratory failure, can be mimicked by other diseases; a cluster of such cases is almost always due to intoxication with one of the types of botulinum toxin. Although classically foodborne from ingestion of preformed toxin from inadequate preparation, botulism can also be linked to ingestion of environmental spores, especially in infants, as well as related to unsterile injections in illicit drug users. - Mod.LL\r\n\r\nProMED map of Armenia: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701856,133>]\n\n[See Also:\nBotulism - Ukraine: 2021 20220120.8700992\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nBotulism - Armenia: (AR) home canned cucumber 20211229.8700510\r\nBotulism - Ukraine (04): (SM) home-canned mushrooms 20211207.8700129\r\nBotulism - Ukraine (03): (ZP) dried fish 20211120.8699794\r\nBotulism - Russia: (TT) smoked fish, smoked goose 20210928.8698761\r\nBotulism - Romania: (AR) homemade ham 20210802.8561737\r\nBotulism - Ukraine (02): (CV) homemade sausage, fatal 20210727.8549096\r\nBotulism - Ukraine: (ZP) retail-bought smoked fish 20210702.8489496\r\nBotulism - Uzbekistan: home canned tomatoes, fatal 20210215.8190626\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nBotulism - Kyrgyzstan 20201126.7974357\r\nBotulism - Ukraine: (OD) smoked fish 20200527.7382682\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nBotulism - Ukraine (02): (KS) smoked fish, fatal 20180914.6023095\r\nBotulism - Ukraine 20180522.5812349\r\nBotulism - Kyrgyzstan 20180314.5686836\r\nBotulism - Austria: (Vienna) outdated pork spread 20180314.5684580\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nBotulism - Sweden: (VG) susp imported beef, recall 20171221.5516181\r\nBotulism - Portugal: (BA) homemade smoked ham 20170807.5233020\r\nBotulism - Germany: imported salted fish, alert, recall 20170509.5023489\r\nBotulism - Romania: (BZ) canned food 20170326.4925806\r\nBotulism - Armenia: homemade canned food 20170122.4784109\r\nBotulism - Slovakia: st A3, 2015 20170810.5241450]\n.................................................sb/ll/tw/jh"

The source of the disease, in this case, is a polio vaccine that has undergone a change and may cause disease in those who are not vaccinated.\r\n\r\nThe most important means of preventing polio is to adhere to routine immunizations at the recommended time according to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health.

Based on the findings of the investigation, further recommendations will be decided.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the virus is found in sewage samples in the area, a finding that happens occasionally, but so far in similar incidents in the past, there have been no clinical cases.\r\n\r\nPolio is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. The virus is contagious and is transmitted from person to person (especially in children). The virus enters the body through the mouth and is excreted in the feces. There are usually no signs of illness and only 1 in 1000 people (who are not vaccinated) will develop symptoms symptomatically with paralysis [the range of AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) to infected has been cited as a high of 1 in 50 infected to a low of 1 in 1000 infected - Mod.MPP].\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Health will continue to update the public as needed and the investigation will progress.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[ProMED would like to thank Yaakov Dickstein for alerting us to this case.\r\n\r\nThe machine translation of the Ministry of Health announcement is the only source that definitively mentions the virus involved is a vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV). All other reports reviewed stopped at saying it was a mutated virus. Reading between the lines to reconstruct the event, environmental sampling identified a VDPV in Jerusalem. Active surveillance was initiated and presumably samples were obtained on individuals in the area (perhaps with a focus on unvaccinated individuals).\r\n\r\nThe prior event in Israel occurred in 2013 and involved a wild poliovirus first identified in environmental samples (ES) in Southern Israel (Rahat) taken in my June 2013. The virus was mentioned to be related to a WPV1 isolated in an environmental sample in Egypt in January 2013 which in turn was genetically similar to a virus identified in Sukkor, Sindh province Pakistan. At the time of identifying the positive ES in Israel, the country exclusively used IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine). Over the course of the following months, positive ESs were found in Israel moving northward, but no AFP cases were ever identified. As the virus kept circulating in the country OPV (oral poliovirus vaccine) was reintroduced into the vaccination schedule in Israel to interrupt the transmission of the WPV.] (see links below to the ProMED coverage of the events in Egypt and Israel in 2013, for additional details)\r\n\r\nQuestions that come to mind now are:\r\nWhich cVDPV is implicated? VDPV1, VDPV2 or VDPV3? Is this VDPV a circulating VDPV? Is it genetically related to cVDPVs from another country or is a locally evolved cVDPV? Does the infected 4-year old child have an AFP illness? Has contact tracing identified other infected children in Jerusalem? Is there a known history of travel or contact with travelers? Is environmental sampling ongoing in the West Bank and Gaza strip as well? Have routine immunization activities been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or is the vaccination status of this child a function of vaccine hesitancy on the part of the parents?

First suspected case of LSD from Bahawalpur region of Punjab province was reported to AHC/CVO dated 27 Oct 2021. Accordingly, National Veterinary Laboratories (NVL) conducted sampling and further investigations in coordination with the local veterinary authority. Other suspected cases of LSD were reported from Jamshoro and Thatta region of Sindh dated 1 Dec 2021, and Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (CVDL) Sindh conducted sampling and further investigations in coordination with the local veterinary authority. Provincial veterinary authorities instantly took control and prevention measures. Since disease was 1st time seen in Pakistan, and diagnostic kits and reagents had to be imported, which took longer time therefore, LSD has been confirmed in March 2022. AHC/CVO Pakistan has immediately issued guidelines for control and prevention of LSD for Provincial Veterinary Authorities.

The disease is of economic importance as it can cause a temporary reduction in milk production, temporary or permanent sterility in bulls, damage to hides and, occasionally, death. Various strains of capripoxvirus are responsible for the disease. These are antigenically indistinguishable from strains causing sheep pox and goat pox yet distinct at the genetic level. LSD has a partially different geographical distribution from sheep and goat pox, suggesting that cattle strains of capripoxvirus do not infect and transmit between sheep and goats. Transmission of LSD virus (LSDV) is thought to be predominantly by arthropods, natural contact transmission in the absence of vectors being inefficient. Lumpy skin disease is endemic in most African and Middle Eastern countries. Between 2012 and 2018, LSD spread into south-east Europe, the Balkans, and the Caucasus as part of the Eurasian LSD epidemic.\"\r\n(Source: OIE Terrestrial Manual 2021, Chapter 3.4.12 Lumpy skin disease <https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.04.12_LSD.pdf>)\r\n\r\nSince 2019, LSD has been reported by several countries in Asia: Bangladesh, India, Cambodia, China, Chinese Taipei, Viet Nam, Bhutan, Hong Kong (SAR-RPC), Laos, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and, most recently, Indonesia and Pakistan. - Mod.CRD\r\n\r\nProMED map of Pakistan: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701867,140>]\n\n[See Also:\nLumpy skin disease - Asia (04): Pakistan (SD) cattle, vaccination 20220306.8701832\r\nLumpy skin disease - Asia (03): Indonesia (RI) cattle, OIE, 1st rep 20220305.8701808\r\nLumpy skin disease - Asia (02): Pakistan, cattle, 1st rep 20220305.8701809\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nLumpy skin disease - Asia (14): Cambodia (TB) cattle, spread 20210811.8586456\r\nLumpy skin disease - Asia (13): Thailand (UT) wild cattle 20210723.8540224\r\nLumpy skin disease - Asia (10): Laos, cattle, 1st rep 20210630.8486677\r\nLumpy skin disease - Asia (09): Malaysia, cattle, 1st rep, OIE 20210625.8474809\r\nLumpy skin disease - Asia (08): Cambodia (OC) cattle, OIE 20210622.8467961\r\nLumpy skin disease - Asia (07): Cambodia (PH) cattle, 1st rep, OIE 20210617.8454034\r\nLumpy skin disease - Asia (04): Taiwan (NT) cattle, OIE 20210417.8313477\r\nLumpy skin disease - Asia (03): Thailand (RE) cattle, 1st rep, OIE 20210409.8298906\r\nLumpy skin disease - Asia (01): Sri Lanka, cattle, 1st rep, OIE 20210120.8120425\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nLumpy skin disease - Asia (02): Hong Kong, Myanmar, cattle, 1st report, OIE 20201127.7976565\r\nLumpy skin disease - Asia: qualitative risk assessment & management, FAO 20201112.7937140\r\nLumpy skin disease - Viet Nam: (LS,CB) cattle, 1st rep, OIE 20201103.7911552\r\nLumpy skin disease - Bhutan: (SM) cattle, 1st rep, OIE 20201031.7905927\r\nLumpy skin disease - India (05): (MP) cattle, spread 20200917.7791246\r\nLumpy skin disease - India (03): (MP,AS) cattle, spread 20200827.7723035\r\nLumpy skin disease - China (03): (JX) cattle, spread 20200805.7644903\r\nLumpy skin disease - Nepal (02): (MO, CH, RT) cattle, 1st rep, OIE 20200731.7630121\r\nLumpy skin disease - Nepal: cattle, 1st rep, susp. 20200722.7601885\r\nLumpy skin disease - China: cattle, spread 20200716.7580459\r\n2019\r\n----\r\nLumpy skin disease - Bangladesh: (CG,DH) cattle, 1st rep 20191126.6799203\r\nLumpy skin disease - India (05): (OR) cattle, 1st rep, OIE 20191119.6787416\r\nLumpy skin disease - China: (XJ) cattle, 1st rep, OIE 20190826.6641564\r\nLumpy skin disease - India: (OR) cattle, susp, RFI 20190822.6635505\r\n2016\r\n----\r\nLumpy skin disease - Europe (20): EU, preventive vaccination policy 20160812.4410864\r\n2015\r\n----\r\nLumpy skin disease, bovine: vaccine assessment (02) update 20150929.3676992\r\nLumpy skin disease, bovine: vaccine assessment, RFI 20150926.3672096]\n.................................................crd/tw/jh"

Since 2013, except for 2020 and 2021, CAR has been reporting at least one MPX outbreak every year, especially in its eastern region. The case fatality rate continues to be very low except for the 2 deaths of 4 cases reported above. However, these are very small numbers and do not provide reliable case fatality rates.\r\n\r\nPrevention of MPX virus infections will not be possible without knowing the source of infection. The question remains about the source of these recent infections within the CAR as well as in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Liberia. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received.\r\n\r\nStudies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected.\r\n\r\nThe MPX virus clade involved in this outbreak and previous ones in the CAR is not mentioned. As noted in previous ProMED posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans -- with a case fatality rate of up to17 percent -- than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. - Mod.TY\n\nProMED map:\nCentral African Republic: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701910,66>]\n\n[See Also:\n2019\r\n----\r\nMonkeypox - Africa: Central African Republic 20190205.6299251\r\n2018\r\n----\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (15): Central African Republic 20181027.6114925\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (12): Central African Republic 20180730.5936829\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (05): Central African Republic (HK) 20180403.5726159\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (04) 20180327.5712702\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (03): Central African Republic (HK) comment 20180322.5703720\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (02): Central African Republic (HK) 20180321.5700108\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (05): Central African Republic 20170715.5177463\r\nMonkeypox - Africa (04): Congo DR, Central African Republic 20170705.5151556\r\n2016\r\n----\r\nMonkeypox - Central African Republic (04): (HK) WHO 20161014.4560870\r\nMonkeypox - Central African Republic (03): (BK,HK) fatal 20160929.4525807\r\nMonkeypox - Central African Republic (02): (BK) fatal 20160924.4512897\r\nMonkeypox - Central African Republic: (MB) RFI 20160119.3947756\r\n2011\r\n----\r\nMonkeypox, human, rodent - Central African Republic 20111129.3488]\n.................................................ty/mj/jh"

The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and migratory wild bird populations.\r\n\r\nAnyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a tool kit, available at <https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/dtf-resources/dtf-resources>.\r\n\r\nUSDA will report these findings to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. OIE trade guidelines call on member countries to not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to such notifications in non-poultry.\r\n\r\nAPHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and non-commercial backyard flocks detected in a state but will not announce subsequent detections in the state. All cases in commercial and non-commercial backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at <https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai>.\r\n\r\nIn addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS' toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. APHIS urges producers to consider bringing birds indoors when possible to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs that must be depopulated during a disease response. APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for non-commercial backyard flocks can be found at <http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov>.\r\n\r\nAdditional background\r\nAvian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus that can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese, and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or \"H\" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or \"N\" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of \"H\" and \"N\" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains that circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high), the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n[ProMED map of Maine, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701740,222>]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] Indiana (Green County): turkeys\r\nDate: Mon 21 Feb 2022\r\nSource: Brownfield Ag News [edited]\r\n<https://brownfieldagnews.com/news/another-case-of-avian-influenza-detected-in-indiana/>\r\n\r\n\r\nIndiana's Board of Animal Health [BOAH] has detected avian influenza at another commercial turkey flock in southwest Indiana. The presumptive-positive case is the 4th farm in Indiana and the 2nd in Greene County to be diagnosed with the virus. Samples are being verified at the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa and should indicate if the virus is the same as the farm diagnosed earlier this month [February 2022] and if the virus is highly pathogenic.\r\n\r\nDepopulation efforts are underway on the premises. To date, nearly 120 000 commercial turkeys have been depopulated.\r\n\r\nThe site is approximately 5 mi [8 km] from the 1st positive case in Greene County. All commercial poultry farms within the expanded control area will be quarantined and tested regularly until the control area is lifted.\r\n\r\nLate last week, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza in 2 non-commercial backyard flocks, one in Maine and another in New York. Those flocks on the affected [premises] were depopulated.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Meghan Grebner]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\r\n\r\n[ProMED map of Indiana, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701740,217>]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] Delaware (New Castle County): commercial poultry\r\nDate: Wed 23 Feb 2022\r\nSource: Delaware.gov [edited]\r\n<https://news.delaware.gov/2022/02/23/avian-influenza-found-in-delaware-chicken-flock-producers-urged-to-take-precautions/>\r\n\r\n\r\nTesting has confirmed a case of avian influenza on a Delaware poultry farm showing increased mortality over the past few days. Following an investigation by the Delaware Department of Agriculture, the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory has confirmed that poultry from this farm have tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI).\r\n\r\nThere is no public health concern, and avian influenza does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain safe to eat.\r\n\r\n\"We have taken immediate action to contain this disease and will continue to work with poultry owners, the industry, and our laboratory partners to protect against its spread,\" said Delaware Secretary of Agriculture Michael T. Scuse. \"This appears to be an isolated case, with no reports of disease among our chicken industry. Delmarva poultry is safe to eat, and consumers can be confident in the safety of their food.\"\r\n\r\nThe Delaware Department of Agriculture and partner agencies, including the US Department of Agriculture, are working to contain the situation, including sampling and quarantining nearby poultry flocks.\r\n\r\nAvian influenza is an airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among chickens through nasal and eye secretions as well as manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.\r\n\r\nThe farm is under quarantine to stop the spread of avian influenza to other flocks in the state. The birds on the affected farm will be depopulated to prevent the spread of disease and will not enter the food system. Due to the severity of this avian influenza, anyone found trespassing on a quarantined farm will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\r\n\r\nThe avian influenza detection was the highly pathogenic H5 type, which is more severe and can cause high mortality in poultry flocks. It is the same strain confirmed in other states and wild birds in the Atlantic flyway.\r\n\r\nIt is not known exactly how the virus was contracted. Scuse encouraged all poultry flock owners to follow the strictest biosecurity on their farms to prevent the spread of the disease. Those steps include the following:\r\n- Limit, monitor, and record any movement of people, vehicles, or animals on or off your farm.\r\n- Permit only essential workers and vehicles to enter the farm to limit the chances of bringing the virus from an outside source.\r\n- Avoid visiting other poultry farms and any unnecessary travel off the farm.\r\n- Disinfect equipment, vehicles, footwear, and other items coming into contact with flocks.\r\n- Keep your flock away from wild or migratory birds, especially waterfowl.\r\n- Isolate any ill animals and contact your veterinarian.\r\n\r\nThis finding is the 1st case of HPAI in commercial poultry in Delaware since 2004.\r\n\r\nPositive test results were confirmed by the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Service Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. Preliminary testing was performed at the University of Delaware's Allen Laboratory in Newark, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network.\r\n\r\nFor more information on avian influenza and protecting poultry, visit <https://de.gov/poultry>.

This detection shows that the virus is present in the environment and highlights the need for poultry owners to protect their flocks by increasing biosecurity.\r\n\r\nAfter several birds from the affected flock died and others showed signs of illness, samples were sent to the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (MSU VDL) for testing. The results from MSU VDL were then confirmed by NVSL.\r\n\r\n\"MDARD is always preparing for situations like this when they arise, which is why we were able to take quick action to contain this disease and help protect against its spread,\" said MDARD Director Gary McDowell. \"At this time, this is an isolated case. There is no threat to public health or food safety. We do not anticipate any disruptions to supply chains across our state. As this situation develops, we will continue to work with our partners at local and federal levels to best mitigate spread and provide outreach.\"\r\n\r\nTo protect other flocks in Michigan, the premises is currently under quarantine, and the birds have been depopulated to prevent further disease spread.\r\n\r\nFortunately, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. Also, no birds or bird products infected with HPAI will enter the food chain. As a reminder, all poultry and eggs should be handled and cooked properly.\r\n\r\n\"Now, with HPAI present in Michigan, it is critical for poultry owners to increase biosecurity measures and to keep wild birds out in order to protect their flocks. Increasing those measures will be important to ensure domestic birds are kept healthy and safe,\" said State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland. \"Simply put, no matter how many birds or which type of birds someone owns, now is the time to protect them. I'm asking all owners to sign up for our email alerts so we can provide them with critical updates on this developing situation.\"\r\n\r\nWhether you have a few backyard birds or a large commercial flock, following these biosecurity measures can help protect Michigan's domestic birds:\r\n- Prevent contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed.\r\n- Wash your hands before and after handling birds as well as when moving between different coops.\r\n- Disinfect boots and other gear when moving between coops.\r\n- Don't share equipment or other supplies between coops or other farms.\r\n- Clean and disinfect equipment and other supplies between uses. If it cannot be disinfected, discard it.\r\n- Use well water or municipal water as drinking water for birds.\r\n- Keep poultry feed secure so there is no contact between the feed/feed ingredients and wild birds or rodents.\r\n\r\nPoultry owners and caretakers should watch for unusual deaths, a drop in egg production, a significant decrease in water consumption, or an increase in sick birds. If avian influenza is suspected, contact MDARD immediately, even if after regular business hours.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n[ProMED map of Michigan, United States: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701740,225>]\n\n[Avian influenza is on the move. It continues to move across the United States. Everyone must be diligent about biosecurity of the birds. Be on the alert for ill birds in your flock, and notice if there are ill birds in flocks you may be hunting. If you are able, bring your birds inside. They can be in your garage or something like a back room. Even in winter, birds will need some type of ventilation, so a fan may be needed, but, of course, severe cold is always an issue as well. The point is to do what is necessary to protect your birds. - Mod.TG]\n\n[See Also:\nAvian influenza (53): Americas (USA) wild bird, poultry, HPAI H5N1 20220225.8701648\r\nAvian influenza (45): Americas (USA) poultry, mixed flock, HPAI H5N1 20220215.8701469\r\nAvian influenza (43): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220214.8701447\r\nAvian influenza (41): Americas (USA) HPAI H5N1, OIE 20220211.8701404\r\nAvian influenza (40): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220210.8701387\r\nAvian influenza (39): Americas (USA) turkey, HPAI H5N1 20220209.8701372\r\nAvian influenza (36): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220208.8701339\r\nAvian influenza (34): Americas (Canada) poultry, HPAI H5N1, OIE 20220204.8701269\r\nAvian influenza (33): Americas (Canada) domestic geese, HPAI H5N1 20220204.8701238\r\nAvian influenza (32): Americas (Canada) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220202.8701217\r\nAvian influenza (30): Americas (USA) wild bird 20220201.8701178\r\nAvian influenza (22): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5N1 20220120.8700990\r\nAvian influenza (19): Americas (USA) wild bird, HPAI H5, OIE 20220117.8700932\r\nAvian influenza (15): Americas (Canada) poultry 20220114.8700858\r\nAvian influenza (04): Americas (Canada) wild bird 20220103.8700643\r\n2021\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (185): Canada (NL) captive bird, HPAI H5N1, OIE 20211227.8700523\r\nAvian influenza (181): Canada (NL) H5N1, poultry 20211225.8700481\r\n2020\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (39): USA (SC) poultry, HPAI H7N3 20200410.7206731\r\n2017\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (79): USA (TN): poultry, HPAI H7N9 20170317.4908223\r\nAvian influenza (78): USA poultry, (AL) H7, (TN) H7N9, both LPAI 20170317.4906690\r\nAvian influenza (71): USA (WI) turkey, HPAI H7N9 20170311.4893871\r\nAvian influenza (69): USA (TN) poultry, HPAI H7N9 20170309.4888517\r\nAvian influenza (67): USA (TN) poultry, HPAI H7, OIE 20170307.4883078\r\nAvian influenza (66): USA (TN) poultry, HPAI, H7 20170305.4881365\r\n2016\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (15): USA (IN) poultry, HPAI & LPAI H7N8 20160121.3953508\r\nAvian influenza (11): USA (IN) poultry, HPAI/LPAI H7N8 20160120.3950429\r\nAvian influenza (08): USA (IN) poultry, HPAI revised to LPAI H7N8, update 20160118.3944747\r\n2015\r\n----\r\nAvian influenza (164): USA (GA) HPAI H5N2, poultry, proactive prevention 20150620.3452030\r\nAvian influenza (151): USA (MN,IA) HPAI H5N2, poultry 20150606.3414670\r\nAvian influenza (141): USA: (MN) HPAI H5N2, poultry 20150531.3397688\r\nAvian influenza (120): USA, HPAI H5N2, poultry, turkey 20150510.3352747\r\nAvian influenza (87): USA, HPAI H5N2, turkey, poultry 20150418.3305689\r\nAvian influenza (80): USA, HPAI H5N2, turkey, poultry 20150415.3298419\r\nAvian influenza (74): USA (MN,ND) HPAI H5N2, turkey 20150412.3292191\r\nAvian influenza (59): USA (MN): turkey, H5N2 20150329.3264089]\n.................................................sb/tg/tw/mpp"

Here, we use a rat model of congenital RVF to identify cellular tropism, pathology, and local immune responses occurring in the placenta during vertical transmission. Infection of pregnant rats during late gestation (embryonic day 14) resulted in vertical transmission to the placenta and widespread viral infection throughout the decidua, basal zone, and labyrinth zone. Some pups delivered from infected dams appeared normal, while others had gross signs of teratogenicity including fetal death. Histopathological lesions were detected in placenta from pups regardless of teratogenicity, while teratogenic pups had more widespread hemorrhage throughout multiple placenta layers. Teratogenic events were also associated with significant increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, type I interferons, and chemokines within the placental tissue. Thus, we found that RVFV displays a high degree of tropism for all placental tissue layers, and that the degree of hemorrhage and inflammatory mediator production is highest in placenta from pups with adverse outcomes. This is the 1st detailed pathological study of the mechanisms of RVFV infection of placental tissue in a tractable rodent model of congenital RVF disease.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[Subscribers are referred to Mod.TY's commentary in ProMED post 20181210.6203158 and to Ref 1, in which the accumulated information on the abortifacient impact of RVF virus infections in ruminants and recent data on vertical transmission in humans are reviewed.\r\n\r\nThe 1st case report of vertical transmission in humans was reported from Saudi Arabia in 2006 (Ref 2).\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------\r\n1.

Veterinarian YH said the dog was \"not doing well at present.\"\r\n \r\nThe SPCA recently reported Auckland was experiencing its worst outbreak in 20 years.\r\n \r\nSome vet clinics were seeing up to 20 cases a day, while cases had also popped up in Christchurch, Wellington and Northland.\r\n \r\nHowell urged pet owners to check with their vets if their dogs were fully vaccinated. \"Puppies should not be taken for walks until fully vaccinated,\" Howell said. \"Unfortunately with parvo, the mortality rate is really high.\"\r\n \r\nOn its Facebook page, the centre issued locations of interest the sick dog had visited. These were the Rolleston Dog Park on (8 Feb 2022), and around the Burnham Military Camp.\r\n \r\nAn SPCA spokesperson said last week its inspectorate was aware of just 1 case in Selwyn.\r\n \r\nBARK Kennels and Cattery manager Kristy Wood said it was concerning to have a case in the district.\r\n \r\nThe facility at Rolleston, registered for 240 dogs, would be extra vigilant to ensure clients' pets were up to date with vaccinations.\r\n \r\nThe New Zealand Veterinary Association said the highly transmissible viral disease affects the gastrointestinal tract. Dogs caught it directly by contacting faeces containing the virus, as well as indirectly by coming into contact with contaminated objects such as food and water bowls or footwear.\r\n \r\nEarly signs of lethargy, lack of appetite and fever typically occurred within 5-to-7 days of being exposed, usually progressing quickly to vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration.\r\n \r\nSix-week to 6-month-old puppies unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated were most at risk.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Susan Sandys]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n\n[Parvovirus (\"parvo\") is a serious canine disease. Clinical signs of the virus in dogs, especially puppies, include severe, bloody diarrhea, lethargy (laying around, no apparent energy, or interest in activities), anorexia (not eating), fever, vomiting, weight loss, weakness, depression, and dehydration.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases, untreated dogs contracting parvovirus will die. Treatment relies on replacing lost body fluids and correcting disturbed electrolyte balance. Both the severity of the challenge and the timing of when treatment is started will affect the outcome. Treatment usually involves intensive care for several days in the veterinary hospital and can be very expensive.\r\n\r\nVaccinating your dog is the best way to prevent canine parvovirus infection.\r\n\r\nParvovirus is a preventable disease. It is prevented with a series of vaccines against the virus. For puppies, the vaccines should begin close to 6 weeks of age and be repeated approximately every 3 weeks until a series of 3 or 4 vaccines has been given. Thereafter, a vaccine should be given annually, as the virus can circulate in populations and your adult dog may be re-exposed through sniffing or licking in public places where other dogs have been or you may track the virus back to your dog on your shoes. Consequently, keeping up with vaccination schedules is critical for the health of your animals. Once the complete puppy series is given, some locations may choose to vaccinate only every 3 years. Please consult with your veterinarian regarding the frequency of adult animal vaccinations in your area.\r\n\r\nMost deaths from parvovirus occur within 48 to 72 hours following the onset of clinical signs. If your puppy or dog shows any of these signs, you should contact your veterinarian immediately (<https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/canine-parvovirus.aspx>).\r\n\r\nIntestinal parasites, especially in puppies, may also cause diarrhea or bloody diarrhea. Do not take a chance the diarrhea or bloody diarrhea may be from parasites, which can also kill your pet. Take the pet to the veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and medical treatment.\r\n\r\nIf you adopt or rescue an animal, get the animal vaccinated immediately because you have no way of knowing where the animal has been or what it has been exposed to. While parvovirus is often associated with puppies, adult dogs can succumb to this virus as well.

It is often sold by \"sweet vendors\" who are frequently found around the schools. Strawberry Quick is a combination of sugar, food coloring, flavors and crystal meth. Symptoms are reported to include chattiness, nervousness, dry mouth, dilated pupils, extreme energy followed by chronic fatigue, paranoia, jaw clenching, increased heart rate, excessive sweating, increased libido, and in severe cases may include hallucinations. There may also be direct effects on the heart, circulation, and neurological systems.\r\n\r\nSome sweet concoctions may include amphetamines, alone or in combination with the meth. If amphetamines are the only drug (no crystal meth) then clinical signs may show an increase in heart rate, palpitations, sweating, nervousness, possible hallucinations and even convulsions.\r\n\r\nThe combination of crystal meth and ampehtamines could be deadly to children, and possibly adults. The child's smaller size means the dose of drugs is potentially more toxic and detrimental to the child. \r\n\r\nThe Anti Drug Alliance SA [South Africa, also known as ADA-SA] encourages parents to teach children never to accept sweets from anyone other than their family and to never accept or purchase sweets from street vendors. The Anti Drug Alliance SA also encourages parents to know the drugs and their clinical signs in case a child displays signs, so they understand what is happening, where and how to seek immediate medical attention, and to be able to explain in clear terms what signs the child display. - Mod.TG\n\nProMED map:\nSouth Africa: <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701732,179>]\n\n.................................................sb/tg/ao/mpp"

All required hospitalisation and one person died. There are 4 people still in hospital.\r\n\r\n\"In recent weeks, Kokobera virus has been detected in adult mosquitoes locally here in the Riverland, and what we have seen so far interstate is the detection of the rare Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in pigs in NSW, Victoria, and Queensland, while West Nile virus (Kunjin variant) was detected in horses in NSW in January [2022],\" deputy chief public health officer Chris Lease said.\r\n\r\n\"Kokobera virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus all belong to a group of viruses called flaviviruses. Most people who are infected with these viruses are asymptomatic or develop a mild febrile illness, but a small proportion of infected people -- less than 1% -- will develop encephalitis, which may be fatal or cause long-term neurological damage.\"\r\n\r\nSymptoms of encephalitis can include confusion, headaches, neck stiffness, tremors, drowsiness and seizures.\r\n\r\nSearch for Japanese encephalitis virus [JEV]\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\nChief veterinary officer Mary Carr said the Department of Primary Industries and Regions was undertaking surveillance measures to monitor for JEV, which is normally only seen in the Torres Strait.\r\n\r\n\"The normal life cycle of JEV is between waterbirds and mosquitoes, which may then accidentally spill over to pigs and horses, but there are currently no confirmed livestock detections of JEV in South Australia,\" Dr. Carr said.\r\n\r\nSentinel chickens along the Murray River are used to monitor for viruses.\r\n\r\nThere have been 77 Ross River cases reported in the state so far this year [2022], compared to 48 cases at the same time last year [2021].\r\n\r\nSA Health has urged people to wear long, loose-fitting, light-coloured clothing outside and use a repellent containing DEET or picaridin.\r\n\r\nIndustry well prepared for an outbreak\r\n--------------------------------------\r\nVictorian Farmers Federation Pig Group president and pork producer Tim Kingma lives just 50 km [31 mi] from the positive case in Echuca and said the industry was well prepared for an outbreak.\r\n\r\n\"For us to see a 1% change in our piggeries, we would know, but for us to see a 10% change, warning bells will be going off straight away,\" Mr. Kingma said.\r\n\r\n\"With threats of Australian [sic African?] Swine Fever over the past few years, the industry takes biosecurity matters very seriously. We already have a lot of mosquitos, so we have a lot of things already implemented on the farms to combat them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kingma said it was important to emphasise that the virus did not impact the safety or quality of the pork meat. There is no issue at all with the meat, it's just a virus that comes in and affects just some pigs,\" he said.\r\n\r\nCSIRO [Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Organization] concerned\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCSIRO director of strategic projects and mosquito expert, Dr. Paul De Barro, said the spread of the virus was a serious concern. \"It'll kill you if you get infected, or has the potential to,\" he said. \"It's not a very common disease, but it's one of those ones which we do actually keep a close watch on, simply because it can cause human fatality.\"\r\n\r\nDr. De Barro said the virus was normally detected across the Northern Territory, Queensland and the Torres Strait, but recent wet conditions had created a perfect storm for the virus to also spread into NSW and Victoria.\r\n\r\nHe said a mosquito named _Culex annulirostris_ was the main transmitter. \"It's an ideal mosquito for La Nina conditions because it loves areas where there's been a bit of flood, where there's water in tree hollows and so on,\" he said. \"This one actually is a highly mobile mosquito, so it'll fly many kilometres. So the real protection is making sure you're not getting bitten.\"\r\n\r\n[Byline: Eugene Boisvert, Eden Hynninen, and Charmayne Allison]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMahmoud Orabi\r\n<ahstandards@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this report. \r\n\r\nAustralia has several mosquito-borne viruses. Vector mosquito populations, and hence virus transmission, is dependent on rainfall to provide breeding habitat. The above report indicates that current La Ni\u00f1a conditions have increased rainfall and some flooding providing breeding sites for _Culex annulirostris__ mosquitoes.

Salido RA, Martino C, Karthikeyan S, et al. (2022). Bacterial metatranscriptomes in wastewater can differentiate virally infected human populations. bioRxiv. doi: <https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.23.481658>]\r\n\r\nIn a recent research report from the United States, currently available on bioRxiv preprint server, scientists have shown that bacterial taxonomic and functional profiles can discriminate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) status even without directly detecting viral transcripts - opening the door for entirely novel approaches in wastewater-based epidemiology.\r\n\r\nWastewater-based epidemiology for tracking diseases represents a concept that is becoming more pervasive in recent years due to many advantages compared to traditional approaches, as it can provide particularly comprehensive information on different communities.\r\n\r\nOne significant advantage is that it is non-invasive and cost-effective when compared to individual clinical testing. Furthermore, it does not necessitate individual consent to clinical testing in order to report the results to public health agencies thus it can be highly beneficial to under-served populations.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, at the moment, the wastewater-based epidemiology scheme is limited to pathogen detection and characterization by using real-time PCR and sequencing methods, which means it cannot detect disease agents for which a screening test has not been developed.\r\n\r\nRecent studies that have used a highly spatially resolved, high-throughput wastewater monitoring system on a college campus showed that it was possible to collect and characterize thousands of wastewater samples with real-time PCR, identifying 85% of clinical cases caused by SARS-CoV-2, and also enable genomic surveillance for emerging variants of concern by complete genome sequencing.\r\n\r\nIn this research paper, a research group led by Dr. Rodolfo A Salido and Dr. Rob Knight from the University of California San Diego in La Jolla (USA) used a metatranscriptomics approach for an untargeted community/population-level disease monitoring strategy.\r\n\r\nRationale behind the study\r\n--------------------------\r\nAkin to many other different pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to cause systematic disruptions in the microbial communities of the human gut (also known as intestinal microbiome), which is the principal human microbial input to wastewater.\r\n\r\nConsequently, metatranscriptomics in this context can leverage correlations in observable changes in wastewater microbiomes with human microbiome disruptions that can be linked to a certain disease state, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) known to affect the gastrointestinal tract as well.\r\n\r\nHere the research group performed untargeted metatranscriptomics on virally-enriched wastewater samples from 10 locations on the University of California San Diego campus, and validated the predictive power for wastewater SARS-CoV-2 status discrimination.\r\n\r\nA proof-of-principle for wastewater-based epidemiology\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nIn a nutshell, the results of this study showed that wastewater metatranscriptomes could divulge traces of rare pathogens via alterations of the microbiome of the infected individuals, which are subsequently reflected in the wastewater microbiome.\r\n\r\nSamples obtained from each sewer hole in this study have shown a distinct microbiome signature, which likely reflects a composite of the individual microbiomes of those contributing to each wastewater stream. This in turn established a proof-of-principle for high-throughput biomarker discovery in wastewater-based epidemiology.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the untargeted nature of this data modality makes it somewhat flexible for monitoring a myriad of diseases at the population scale and is superior to metagenomic monitoring since it encompasses all living organisms and viruses.\r\n\r\nScreening large populations\r\n---------------------------\r\nThis type of wastewater sample monitoring at building-level resolution can screen large populations for SARS-CoV-2, prioritizing testing and isolation efforts. In addition, the methodology can be applied to different types of biospecimens and have a considerable impact beyond the field of epidemiology.\r\n\r\n\"One of the limitations of the proposed strategy is the narrow stability of the samples' RNA molecules,\" caution study authors in this bioRxiv preprint paper that is currently under peer-review.\r\n\r\n\"However, our methods don't claim to comprehensively characterize the wastewater metatranscriptome and instead focus on the fact that changes in the observable bacterial metatranscriptome are sufficient to discriminate the wastewater's viral status, with SARS-CoV-2 detection status serving as a relevant case study\", they add.\r\n\r\nBut even though pivotal features of the bacterial metatranscriptome discriminate SARS-CoV-2 detection, additional work will be necessary to determine how broadly this phenomenon can actually be generalized to other pathogens.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Tomislav Mestrovic]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] Coronavirus variants\r\nDate: Sun 27 Feb 2022\r\nSource: Los Angeles Times [edited]\r\n<https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-02-27/covid-19-virus-vaccines-evasion-t-cells>\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now well known that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can mutate to evade vaccine protection against infection. The omicron variants -- BA.1, B1.1 and BA.2 -- can infect those who were previously infected by other variants, even when vaccinated. A 3rd booster shot offers some protection from an omicron infection, but it wanes after 3 or 4 months, leaving most people susceptible to reinfection. That said, the immunity conveyed by prior infection or vaccination still dramatically reduces the incidence of hospitalization and death.\r\n\r\nWe have also come to realize that our main saviors against COVID-19 turn out not to be antibodies, but rather another part of the immune system: T cells. Studies show that the strength of our long-lived T-cell response to the virus' proteins -- especially by T cells that recognize the spike protein -- strongly correlates with the degree of protection.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 types of T cells, CD4+ and CD8+, which are distinguished by proteins on their surface. Because CD4+ T cells mostly assist in the production of antibodies, the CD8+ T cells are the real heroes of the story. Once they identify an invader they remember from a previous encounter, they act quickly to move in for the kill, demolishing infected cells and cutting short the life cycle of the virus.\r\n\r\nUntil omicron, the differences in neutralization by vaccine-induced antibodies and by monoclonal antibodies were relatively minor. But the process by which T cells recognize viral proteins is very different from that of antibodies, which recognize structures on the intact viral protein. We know that these critical structures, particularly those of the exterior spike protein, differ from variant to variant. It is precisely such structural diversity that allows the virus to evade most antibodies made in response to natural infection and vaccination.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, T cells do not recognize intact proteins. Rather, T-cell recognition occurs when a viral protein within a cell is chopped into short segments and cradled in the grip of a cellular protein called MHC type 1. MHC type 1 presents the viral fragment to the T cell at the cell surface, where the T cell can recognize the combination of the viral fragment presented by the MHC type 1 protein.\r\n\r\nT cells recognize and react to a very broad array of viral protein fragments. For SARS-CoV-2, these fragments overlap very little with the regions of the virus that are sensitive to neutralization by antibodies. That is why T-cell responses to viral infection are generally preserved across variants.\r\n\r\nUntil omicron, vaccines that use one viral protein raised almost the same T-cell response to all variants. But now the situation has changed. Our MHC type 1 proteins are diverse, and each recognizes a unique set of viral protein fragments. Our reaction to viral proteins thus depends on their sequence and that of our own particular MHC type 1 set of proteins.\r\n\r\nConsider a recent study by Gaurav D. Gaiha and his colleagues, examining T-cell responses to the Wuhan, delta and omicron strains in people who have been either infected, vaccinated and boosted, or infected and vaccinated but not boosted. They found that most people who are infected after vaccination have strong and durable CD4+ and CD8+ responses to all 3 variants.\r\n\r\nBut there was one worrying discovery. Approximately 20% of those vaccinated showed a decline of greater than 50% in T-cell response to omicron, compared to the Wuhan and delta variants. These poor T-cell responses were not correlated with sex or age, and follow-up experiments revealed that the difference was due to lower CD8+ reactivity, rather than to the CD4+ T-cell response.\r\n\r\nThe authors speculate that CD8+ T cells' inability to respond to omicron may be due to a lack of recognition of the mutated peptides. Indeed, their theoretical calculations are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in the amino acid sequence of the omicron spike protein underlie the observed blind spots in T-cell recognition. Inherited differences in the ability to recognize specific protein fragments likely account for some people's failure to mount anti-omicron defenses. The authors offer the conjecture that \"it is possible that these individuals will have reduced protection against severe disease.\"\r\n\r\nOne sobering conclusion is that omicron has drifted so far from the original strain that 20% of people in the study may not be fully protected either from infection or from hospitalization and death. However, the study found that a 3rd vaccine dose increases T-cell responses by 20 times or more.\r\n\r\n\"While the omicron spike protein was able to escape T cells in a subset of individuals,\" Gaiha told me, \"what we learned is that this deficiency in T-cell recognition can be overcome by booster vaccination. In addition, we found that non-spike proteins could be attractive targets for 2nd-generation vaccines to protect against future SARS-CoV-2 evolution.\"\r\n\r\nGaiha espouses an optimistic interpretation. But omicron is a warning that future variants may escape both antibodies and T-cell immunity. We cannot predict whether a variant will arise that evades the vaccines' ability to protect against infection and serious illness, but we must be prepared for such a threat, lest we remain unguarded against it.\r\n\r\n[Byline: William A.

DOI: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.01.029>\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nThe SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant (B.1.1.529) contains mutations that mediate escape from antibody responses, although the extent to which these substitutions in spike and non-spike proteins affect T cell recognition is unknown. In this study, we show that T cell responses in individuals with prior infection, vaccination, both prior infection and vaccination, and boosted vaccination are largely preserved to omicron spike and non-spike proteins. However, we also identify a subset of individuals (approx. 21%) with a >50% reduction in T cell reactivity to the omicron spike. Evaluation of functional CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cell responses confirmed these findings and revealed that reduced recognition to omicron spike is primarily observed within the CD8+ T cell compartment potentially due to escape from HLA binding. Booster vaccination enhanced T cell responses to omicron spike. In contrast to neutralizing immunity, these findings suggest preservation of T cell responses to the omicron variant, although with reduced reactivity in some individuals. - Mod.LK]\r\n\r\n******\r\n[4] Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)\r\nDate: Thu 24 Feb 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious disease research and Policy) [edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/02/study-90-young-ecmo-eligible-covid-patients-us-hospital-died-amid-rationing>\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly 90% of adult COVID-19 patients who were eligible for --but didn't receive-- extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during the height of the pandemic died in the hospital owing to a lack of resources, even though they were young and had few underlying health issues, according to a natural experiment published late last week in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.\r\n\r\nReserved for youngest, sickest\r\n------------------------------\r\nVanderbilt University researchers prospectively analyzed data from all COVID-19 patients referred to a single center for ECMO from [1 Jan to 31 Aug 2021]. Patients qualified for ECMO if they were younger than 60 years, had a body mass index (BMI) less than 55 kg/m2, had received mechanical ventilation for more than 7 days, or had irreversible neurologic injury, chronic lung disease, cancer, or advanced multi-organ dysfunction.\r\n\r\nPatients also had to have no more than 3 selected contraindications, including age older than 50 years, BMI greater than 45 kg/m2, underlying illnesses, receipt of mechanical ventilation for more than 4 days, acute kidney injury, receipt of vasopressors (drugs used to treat low blood pressure), hospitalization for more than 14 days, or a period of more than 4 weeks since COVID-19 diagnosis.\r\n\r\nA systematic assessment of the health system's resources to provide ECMO for eligible patients (ie, equipment, personnel, and intensive care unit bed availability) was conducted. If resources were available, patients were started on ECMO and then transferred to an ECMO center, but patients were not referred if resources were already at capacity. Patients transferred to other regional ECMO centers were started on the treatment after arrival at the ECMO facility.\r\n\r\n\"Even when saving ECMO for the youngest, healthiest and sickest patients, we could only provide it to a fraction of patients who qualified for it,\" lead author Whitney Gannon, MSN, MS, said in a Vanderbilt news release. \"I hope these data encourage hospitals and federal authorities to invest in the capacity to provide ECMO to more patients.\"\r\n\r\n61% of patients didn't receive ECMO\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nThe health system didn't maintain a waiting list for ECMO because of the short eligibility window for ECMO after tracheal intubation and the long average length of ECMO for patients already receiving the treatment.\r\n\r\nAmong 240 COVID-19 patients referred for ECMO, 26 (10.8%) didn't complete the referral evaluation, 44 (18.3%) didn't meet the criteria for severity of lung injury, 80 (33.3%) had contraindications to treatment, and 90 (37.5%) were eligible for ECMO. Median patient age was 40 years, and 27.8% were female.\r\n\r\nA total of 55 patients (61.1%) were not transferred to an ECMO facility and didn't receive the therapy because of a shortage of resources. As many as 49 of these patients (89.1%) died in the hospital, versus 15 of 35 patients (42.9%) who received ECMO (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.43).\r\n\r\nThe health system had ECMO capacity for 35 patients (38.9%), of whom 24 were started on the treatment at the hospital before transfer to an ECMO facility, while 11 were transferred to another regional center. Eight of the 11 patients were started on treatment after arrival at the center, and 3 died or developed a contraindication to ECMO after arrival but before treatment was started. Characteristics of both groups of patients were similar at the time of referral.\r\n\r\nSenior author Jonathan Casey, MD, said that the study adds evidence that ECMO works. \"Because some patients die despite receiving ECMO, there has been debate about how much benefit it provides,\" he said. \"This study shows the answer is a huge benefit. This data suggests that, on average, providing ECMO to 2 patients will save a life and give a young person the potential to live for decades.\"\r\n\r\nCoauthor Matthew Semler, MD, said that many people not working in medicine during the pandemic struggled to understand the reality of \"strained\" or \"overwhelmed\" hospitals. \"This article helps make those effects tangible,\" he said. \"When the number of patients with COVID-19 exceeds hospital resources, young, healthy Americans die who otherwise would have lived.\"\r\n\r\n[Byline: Mary Van Beusekom]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n[Citation.

There has been a downward trend in the number of cases and deaths globally, however, transmission levels are still quite high. - Mod.UBA]\n\n[See Also:\nCOVID-19 update (60): animal, China, origin, research 20220227\r\nCOVID-19 update (59): orphans, workforce, masks, AMA, Hong Kong, WHO, global 20220226.8701667\r\nCOVID-19 update (58): heart, Canada vacc, mortality, masks, S Asia, WHO, global 20220226.8701656\r\nCOVID-19 update (57): omicron BA.2, S Korea, MIS-C, vacc & blood clots, global 20220226.8701651\r\nCOVID-19 update (56): animal, SARS-CoV-2 delta variant, cat 20220224.8701639\r\nCOVID-19 update (55): masks, ivermectin, omicron re-infection, WHO 20220224.8701627\r\nCOVID-19 update (54): long COVID, antiviral combo, S.

This means that these 2 production facilities are now affected. AquaGen stressed that other production facilities have not been affected.\r\n\r\nAquaGen said it has carried out individual screening of all broodstock in their production facilities.\r\n\r\nThe suspicion arose as a result of sampling taken last week [week of 1 Mar 2022] from the broodstock group moved to Kyrks\u00e6ter\u00f8ra.\r\n\r\nThe findings have now been reported to the Norwegian Food Safety Authority.

New research from Alfred Health has revealed the areas of Brimbank and Melton in the city's north-west, and Casey in the city's south-east, are showing a surging number of gonorrhea cases.\r\n\r\nThe study is the 1st of its kind to track the geographical distribution of the STI [sexually transmitted infection] over 10 years and found lower income areas further from Melbourne's CBD [Central Business District] were more susceptible.\r\n\r\n'Why this is occurring is the million-dollar question,' Alfred Health epidemiologist and biostatistician Eric Chow told The Age. Historically, gonorrhoea was mostly circulated among men who had sex with other men but the research also shows women are getting infected at an alarming rate.\r\n\r\nThe infection, also known as 'the clap' is caused by bacteria which colonises the genital region and can be treated by antibiotics. But, if left untreated, it can cause infertility in women. Worryingly, there is also an antibiotic resistant version that has been detected in cases in every Australian state and territory.\r\n\r\nVictoria recorded more than 7000 cases last year [2021] but experts say the real number is likely much higher with many cases not showing symptoms and going undetected.\r\n\r\nAssociate Professor Chow said since 2010, gonorrhoea infections in females had increased more than 5-fold. The number rose from 291 to almost 1600 last year [2021], showing heterosexual gonorrhoea was endemic in Australia.\r\n\r\nHe said lockdowns had not seemed to slow the spread of the infection, particularly in lower socioeconomic areas. 'It's just gone up exponentially among women in the outer suburbs of Melbourne,' Mr Chow said. 'We really don't know whether it is because of the lack of sexual health literacy and services, or whether it is more risky behaviour in those areas. But definitely the outer suburbs are becoming our greatest area of concern.'\r\n\r\nThe Alfred Institute has established 3 general practice clinics in the Melbourne suburbs of Hillside, Tarneit, and Clayton to combat the outbreak.\r\n\r\n[Byline: Brett Lackey]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2]\r\nDate: Tue 8 Mar 2022 11:55 AEDT\r\nSource: The Age [edited]\r\n<https://www.theage.com.au/national/gonorrhoea-epidemic-hits-citys-outer-suburbs-20220302-p5a0vv.html>\r\n\r\n\r\nOutbreaks of gonorrhoea are spreading rapidly through Melbourne's outer suburbs, with doctors warning that the municipalities of Melton, Casey, and Brimbank are now battling an evolving epidemic of the sexually transmitted disease that has alarmed and perplexed experts. New research from Alfred Health has, for the 1st time, tracked the geographical distribution of gonorrhoea over a decade, finding growing clusters of the sexually transmitted infection were infiltrating some of the most socioeconomically disadvantaged areas of Melbourne.\r\n\r\nAlfred Health epidemiologist and biostatistician Eric Chow, who led the study, said while the disease previously circulated among men who had sex with other men, a growing number of women were becoming infected. \"Why this is occurring is the million-dollar question,\" Associate Professor Chow said. \"We really don't know whether it is because of the lack of sexual health literacy and services, or whether it is more risky behaviour in those areas. But definitely, the outer suburbs are becoming our greatest area of concern.\"\r\n\r\nVictoria recorded more than 7000 gonorrhoea cases last year [2021], compared to roughly 6500 cases in 2020, but screening of people without symptoms plummeted by almost 70 per cent during the pandemic and experts warn the true number of infections is probably far higher than official state government figures.\r\n\r\nAssociate Professor Chow said the study found that since 2010, gonorrhoea infections in females had increased more than 5-fold from 291 in a year, to almost 1600 last year [2021], showing heterosexual gonorrhoea was now endemic in Australia.\r\n\r\nThe research comes as Victoria battles a wave of syphilis outbreaks that has led to at least 4 fetal deaths in Victoria in recent years after several babies contracted syphilis from their mothers. The sharp rise in deaths followed a 14-year absence of fatal cases. Exactly why this is occurring remains unclear. Growing research suggests casual sexual activity reduced and dating app use declined during the pandemic.\r\n\r\nAssociate Professor Chow did say increased sexual promiscuity linked to the explosion in dating apps might have been one factor that had led to a sustained increase in STIs. But he believes the issue is far more complex than that, noting there was a rise in gonorrhoea in the early 2010s, before the online introduction apps became commonplace. \"One of the most concerning things to us is the increase in the disease among heterosexual men and women,\" Associate Professor Chow said. \"It's just gone up exponentially among women in the outer suburbs of Melbourne.\"\r\n\r\nThe research found that there was the sharpest rise in cases between 2017 and 2019 with 24 825 notified gonorrhoea cases in Victoria, of which one in 5 were women, 13 per cent were heterosexual males, and about 42 per cent were men who had sex with men. It also found rates of infections of the STI had more than tripled in the outer suburbs of Melbourne.\r\n\r\nInfections of gonorrhoea among men who have sex with men are concentrated in inner metropolitan Melbourne, and experts said research showed this cohort were the most likely to be regularly screened for STIs, which may explain the higher rates of detection.\r\n\r\nBut of increasing concern to doctors, is the growing number of cases among women concentrated in the outer suburbs, where there remained a worrying lack of health services screening for sexually transmitted diseases and Associate Professor Chow said there was an urgent need for more support.\r\n\r\nData from the Victorian government's infectious diseases surveillance report shows the City of Yarra, which includes inner-city suburbs Fitzroy, Collingwood, and Abbotsford, had the highest increase in cases, reporting 535 infections last year [2021], compared to 380 in 2020.\r\n\r\nProblematically, gonorrhoea has become increasingly immune to antibiotics and a drug-resistant strain of the bacteria, dubbed a \"super-superbug\", has been detected in every Australian state and territory. Associate Professor Chow said there were international concerns about rising resistance to the antibiotic drugs prescribed to treat gonorrhoea. \"This is quite concerning because it will make the infection more difficult to treat,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAssociate Professor Marcus Chen, from Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, said experts were now examining where Victorians were acquiring gonorrhoea, noting a limitation of the recent study was that it was based on the residence of the notified cases. \"We're getting a feeling there's an element of marginalisation linked to outbreaks,\" Associate Professor Chen said. \"There's obviously something driving new infections, but if testing and treatment were sufficient to offset it, then you wouldn't get a worsening epidemic, which is what we are seeing.\"\r\n\r\n[Byline: Melissa Cunningham]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\n\n[\"Melbourne is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Victoria and the 2nd most populous city in Australia.\" (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne>). A ProMED map of Australia can be accessed at <https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701917,295>.\r\n\r\nIn May 2021, ProMED posted a news report of an outbreak of syphilis in urban poor women in Melbourne's outer suburbs (Brimbank and Melton to the city's northwest, and Casey, to the city's southeast) that was associated with an increase in cases of congenital and ocular syphilis (see ProMED post Syphilis - Australia: (VI) ocular, women, congenital, urban poor, genotyping, alert 20210518.8367315). In that outbreak, scientists were said to be using genomic sequencing for the 1st time to track syphilis cases.\r\n\r\nThe May 2021 report attributed the increase in STDs in lower-socio economic communities in Melbourne's outer suburbs in part to barriers in accessing healthcare. A report on the effects that social and economic conditions in these areas of Melbourne have on health care can be found in a report entitled \"HealthWest Partnership response to the Senate Committees on Community Affairs: Australia's domestic response to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Commission on Social Determinants of Health report -- Closing the gap within a generation\" (<https://bit.ly/3yiFwrI>).\r\n\r\nThe current news reports above are now reporting an outbreak of gonorrhea, another sexually transmitted disease (STD), in the same Melbourne outer suburbs of Brimbank, Melton, and Casey as previously reported for syphilis, among women apparently in the same demographic group that was affected by syphilis. A map showing the location of these 3 Melbourne suburbs can be found at <https://www.theage.com.au/national/gonorrhoea-epidemic-hits-citys-outer-suburbs-20220302-p5a0vv.html>.

Although this has not been conclusively proven, scientists believe that an overactive and abnormal immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for the damage seen in severe COVID-19. \r\n\r\nGenetics influence the response of the innate immune system. And so, genetic differences may help explain why some people are more likely to develop severe COVID-19.\r\n\r\nPrevious research has identified relationships between different genetic factors, hospitalization, and the need for ventilation due to COVID-19.

Weaknesses include the reliance on data from other studies, which could be subject to error despite quality control measures.\r\n\r\nDr. Palmos stated, \"Clinical studies in patients would need to be carried out first to confirm our findings. One such study is the COVID-Clinical Neuroscience Study, which is investigating the causes behind different aspects of COVID-19.\" [<https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/covid-clinical-neuroscience-study/>]\r\n\r\nDr. Youssef told MNT, \"Once you start applying [the data] widely, then you understand the [true] impact.\" He believes that this study \"adds another piece in that puzzle [...] that would inform which interventions would be offered to patients depending on their risk profile.\"\r\n\r\n[Byline: Lori Uildriks]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n******\r\n[2] Host genetic variation\r\nDate: Mon 7 Mar 2022\r\nSource: Nature [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04576-6>\r\n\r\n\r\nCitation\r\nKousathanas, A., Pairo-Castineira, E., Rawlik, K. et al.

Host genetic variation influences the development of illness requiring critical care or hospitalization following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The GenOMICC (Genetics of Mortality in Critical Care) study enables the comparison of genomes from critically-ill cases with population controls in order to find underlying disease mechanisms. Here, we use whole genome sequencing in 7491 critically-ill cases compared with 48 400 controls to discover and replicate 23 independent variants that significantly predispose to critical COVID-19. We identify 16 new independent associations, including variants within genes involved in interferon signalling (IL10RB, PLSCR1), leucocyte differentiation (BCL11A), and blood type antigen secretor status (FUT2). Using transcriptome-wide association and colocalisation to infer the effect of gene expression on disease severity, we find evidence implicating multiple genes, including reduced expression of a membrane flippase (ATP11A), and increased mucin expression (MUC1), in critical disease. Mendelian randomisation provides evidence in support of causal roles for myeloid cell adhesion molecules (SELE, ICAM5, CD209) and coagulation factor F8, all of which are potentially druggable targets. Our results are broadly consistent with a multi-component model of COVID-19 pathophysiology, in which at least 2 distinct mechanisms can predispose to life-threatening disease: failure to control viral replication, or an enhanced tendency towards pulmonary inflammation and intravascular coagulation. We show that comparison between critically-ill cases and population controls is highly efficient for detection of therapeutically-relevant mechanisms of disease.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n\r\n******\r\n[3] Mental decline\r\nDate: Wed 9 Mar 2022\r\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]\r\n<https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/mental-decline-seen-older-covid-patients-1-year-later>\r\n\r\n\r\nMental decline seen in older COVID patients 1 year later\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nCognitive impairment was more common among COVID-19 patients 60 years and older--particularly those with severe illness--released from hospitals in Wuhan, China, than among their uninfected peers, according to a 1-year follow-up study yesterday in JAMA Neurology.\r\n\r\nA team led by researchers at Daping Hospital in Chongqing, China, followed 1438 COVID-19 survivors aged 60 and older released from one of 3 dedicated COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan from 10 Feb -- 10 Apr 2020, and compared them with 438 of their uninfected spouses.\r\n\r\nBecause pre-COVID cognitive status wasn't available, family members provided their perceptions of cognitive changes using the Chinese version of the short form of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). The questionnaire contains 16 items that rate changes in memory and other domains, with decline defined as an item score of 3.5 or higher. \r\n\r\nTrained raters interviewed COVID-19 patients at 12 months over the phone to evaluate cognition using the Chinese version of Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status-40 (TICS-40), which includes 10 variables and has a maximum of 40 points. A score of 20 or lower was considered indicative of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), while a score of 12 or lower indicated dementia, and a decrease of 3 points or more was considered clinically meaningful cognitive decline.\r\n\r\nOf the COVID-19 patients. 48.1% were men, median age was 69 years, and none had a history of dementia. The control group was 50.7% men, and the median age was 67 years.\r\n\r\nThe incidence of impaired cognition among COVID-19 survivors was 12.5% 12 months after hospital release. COVID-19 survivors had lower TICS-40 scores than controls at both 6 months (median, 29 vs 30 points) and 12 months (29 vs 31).\r\n\r\nSeverely ill patients had lower TICS-40 scores than those with milder illness and controls (median score, 24 vs 30 vs 31) at 6 months; at 12 months, they had lower scores than controls (22.5 vs 31). Patients with mild or moderate illness and controls differed in IQCODE scores but not TICS-40 over follow-up.\r\n\r\nAmong severely ill COVID-19 patients, 10% had dementia and 26.5% had MCI at 6 months. At 12 months, 15% had dementia and 26.2% had MCI, much higher than in those with milder illness (dementia, 0.8%; MCI, 5.4%) and controls (dementia, 0.7%; MCI, 5%). Survivors of mild or moderate COVID-19 and controls had similar incidences of dementia and MCI at both 6 and 12 months.\r\n\r\nSevere illness was tied to a higher risk of early-onset cognitive decline (odds ratio [OR], 4.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3 -- 7.2), late-onset cognitive decline (OR, 7.6; 95% CI, 3.6 -- 16), and progressive cognitive decline (OR, 19; 95% CI, 9.1 -- 39.5), while milder COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk of early-onset cognitive decline (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3 -- 2.3) after adjusting for age, sex, educational attainment, body mass index (BMI), and underlying illnesses.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of progressive decline was 21.2% with severe COVID-19, 1.2% with non-severe COVID-19, and 2.3% in controls.\r\n\r\nSevere COVID-19 was linked to a higher risk of cognitive impairment at 12 months (OR, 9.1; 95% CI, 5.6 -- 14.8), but milder illness was not (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7 -- 1.8), after adjusting for age, sex, educational attainment, BMI, and underlying illnesses.\r\n\r\nAmong a subset of 438 patients and their spouses, COVID-19 survivors were older (median age, 68 vs 67 years) and had a higher incidence of hypertension (47% vs 34.5%). Both nonsevere (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1 -- 3) and severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 3.6 -- 9.8) in this group were tied to a higher risk of cognitive impairment at 12 months, after adjustment for risk factors.\r\n\r\nThe study authors noted that impaired cognition is common in the months after COVID-19 infection, especially among older patients. \"It is worth noting that 21% of individuals with severe cases in this cohort experienced progressive cognitive decline, suggesting that COVID-19 may cause long-lasting damage to cognition,\" they wrote.\r\n\r\n\"These findings imply that the pandemic may substantially contribute to the world dementia burden in the future.\"\r\n\r\nPotential factors in post-COVID cognitive decline, the authors said, include long-term low oxygen levels, chronic systemic inflammation, and direct viral invasion of the brain and resultant neuronal damage.\r\n\r\n\"In this cohort study of COVID-19 survivors 60 years and older who were discharged from COVID-19-designated hospitals in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially severe infection, was associated with an increase in risk of longitudinal cognitive decline,\" the researchers concluded. \"The findings highlight the importance of immediate measures to deal with this challenge.\"\r\n\r\n[Byline: Mary Van Beusekom]\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n\r\n[Citation.

Median patient age was 55 years, 70.6% were Hispanic, 57.9% were men, and 90% needed supplemental oxygen during hospitalization.\r\n\r\nThe rate of hospital readmission or death within 14 days of release was 9.1% in patients who continued dexamethasone, compared with 11.4% among patients who didn't, but the difference wasn't statistically significant.\r\n\r\nThe adjusted odds ratio (OR) for readmission or death within 14 days was 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 -- 1.30) for patients who continued dexamethasone, compared with those who did not. A sensitivity analysis that limited the treatment group to those given exactly 10 days of dexamethasone showed comparable results (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.55 -- 1.43).\r\n\r\nA subgroup analysis stratified by length of dexamethasone therapy in the hospital also yielded similar findings (1 to 3 days: OR, 0.71; 4 to 9 days: OR, 1.01), oxygen requirement at release (room air: OR, 0.91; supplemental oxygen use: OR, 0.76), and illness duration at release (10 days or less: OR, 0.81; more than 10 days: OR, 0.94).\r\n\r\nThe study authors noted that corticosteroids like dexamethasone were the first type of medication to show a survival benefit in severely ill COVID-19 patients and are now a mainstay of hospital treatment. Because early readmissions after hospital release are largely due to respiratory causes that probably reflect illness progression, the authors had theorized that continuing corticosteroids could reduce these outcomes.\r\n\r\n\"Continuing treatment with dexamethasone, 6mg/d, at discharge was not associated with a reduction in 14-day all-cause readmission or mortality,\" the researchers wrote. \"This finding suggests that dexamethasone should not be routinely prescribed beyond discharge.\"\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nMary Marshall\r\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\r\n\r\n[Citation.

JAMA Netw Open. 2022;5(3):e221455. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.1455\r\n\r\nIntroduction. Corticosteroids were the first medication class to demonstrate mortality benefit among patients with COVID-19 and are now a cornerstone of COVID-19 treatment. In the Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial, the use of dexamethasone, 6 mg/d, up to 10 days or until discharge resulted in lower mortality. However, with no standardized discharge practices, corticosteroid prescription practices at discharge have varied.\r\n\r\nConclusions and relevance. In this cohort study of patients with COVID-19, continuing treatment with dexamethasone, 6mg/d, at discharge was not associated with a reduction in 14-day all-cause readmission or mortality. This finding suggests that dexamethasone should not be routinely prescribed beyond discharge for individuals with COVID-19. - Mod.LK]\r\n\r\n********\r\n[5] WHO: Daily new cases reported (as of 9 Mar 2022)\r\nDate: Wed 9 Mar 2022\r\nSource: WHO [abridged, edited]\r\n<https://covid19.who.int/table>\r\n\r\n\r\n*Daily case reports as of 9 Mar 2022 16:48 CET\r\n\r\nSurveillance\r\n------------\r\nWHO region (no. countries/territories):\r\nTotal confirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWestern Pacific Region (19): 29 262 597 (730 009) / 189 656 (892)\r\nEuropean Region (61): 184 618 493 (777 549) / 1 894 846 (2509)\r\nSouth East Asia Region (10): 56 285 919 (55 423) / 767 165 (533)\r\nEastern Mediterranean Region (22): 21 362 890 (14 737) / 337 357 (253)\r\nRegion of the Americas (54): 148 322 100 (125 821) / 2 652 042 (2289)\r\nAfrican Region (49): 8 460 530 (669) / 170 403 (11)\r\nCases on an international conveyance: 764 (0) / 13 (0)\r\n\r\nConfirmed cases (new cases in last 24 hours) / Total deaths (new deaths in last 24 hours)\r\nGrand total: 448 313 293 (1 704 208) / 6 011 482 (6487)\r\n\r\n--\r\nCommunicated by:\r\nProMED\r\n\r\n[Data by country, area, or territory for 9 Mar 2022 can be accessed at \r\n<https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WHO%20Data%20Tables%20MAR9_1646937489.pdf>.\r\n\r\n- The Americas region reported 7.3% of cases and 35.2% of deaths in the past 24 hours having reported more than 148.32 million cases, 2nd to the European region, as the most severely affected region.
